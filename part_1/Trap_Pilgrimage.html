<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span> short by-street paved from side to
side. Narrow house-fronts and the endmost
houses, hiding the passage that curved
round into the further street, high enough to
keep out of sight the neighbouring cubes of
model dwellings and to leave, as principal
feature in the upper air, the spire of St. Pancras
Church. An old little street. A scrap of old
London standing apart, between the Bloomsbury
squares and the maze of streets towards
the City. The light gleaming from its rain-washed
flagstones gave it a provincial air and
a freshness unknown to the main streets,
between whose buildings lay modern roadways
dulled by mud or harsh with grimy dust.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
Whenever during all her London years
Miriam had passed the spot where it opened
into the thoroughfare, the little by-way had
drawn her eyes; always stating its sequestered
charm. Entering it now for the first time she
had a sense of arriving nowhere.
</p>

<p>
She found her number to the right, just
beyond the opening, on a blistered door, whose
knocker, a blurred, weather-worn iron face,
gazed sadly downwards. Next the door,
within a small window screened from the interior
by a frayed serge curtain, were ranged
small blocks of stone and marble, polished
columns, scraps of moulding; and in the centre
upon an oblong mount an alabaster finger. A
lady’s forefinger, fastidiously posed—the nail,
smooth joints and softly curving flesh most
delicately carved. Its white cleanliness seemed
to rebuke the dust that lay thick upon the
other objects and made their welcome quiet
and impersonal. It was personal, emotional.
Arrogant, calling the eye from the surrounding
dusty peace.
</p>

<p>
Dust lay even upon the large grey cat compactly
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
curled amongst the sharp angles and
looking forth with a green eye, glass-clear and
startlingly bright in contrast to the dried
socket from which its fellow should have shone.
</p>

<p>
She raised the heavy knocker and tapped.
The sounds echoed down the empty court and
left a stillness into which flowed her own
tremulous stillness. Down the street a black
cat came towards her, serene and unnoticing,
keeping aloof along the centre of the way.
</p>

<p>
Yet she was an inhabitant of Flaxman’s
Court. Up there, on the upper floors of the
house that remained so quiet before her claim
were rooms as quiet, her own. Soon she would
daily be slipping out into this small brightness,
daily coming back to it, turning from strident
thoroughfares to enter its sudden peace.
</p>

<p>
She knocked again, more loudly. If Miss
Holland were not there, she was shut out. But
certainly the door would open. She knew, so
careless was her spirit, that she was not shut
out. In a moment there came the sound of
boots upon uncarpeted stairs. The door
opened; but not upon Miss Holland. There
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
before her was the dark passage that skirted the
little shop and led to the staircase, the way up
to the quiet, eager, empty rooms, obstructed.
</p>

<p>
Since he stood aside, welcoming, and greeted
her by name, the man could be none other
than the landlord. An unconsidered item,
appearing at the outset. Not only postponing
joy, but enhancing it; for if this meeting
were its price, how good must be what lay
ahead.
</p>

<p>
She hoped that during the swift moment of
confronting once more this long-forgotten way
of being, that she had shown no sign of antipathy.
She could not be sure, for in that
moment she had been back again in bitter
conflict. The shape was a duplicate. The
same tall, grey-clad form, neither thin nor
solid, the same pale eyes, arrogant and embarrassed,
the florid skin, the drooping fair moustache
half-hiding the fleshy red lips through
which had come the voice familiar and shunned
from beyond memory.
</p>

<p>
She went forward followed by the voice
into an air dense with shut-in odours dried
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
brown by stale pipe-smoke. It was as if the
door just closed behind her were never set
open, and any egress there might be at the
back, closely sealed. And here, at the centre
of a fog of smells of which the air of the
passage was but the fringe, someone was
living.
</p>

<p>
The voice behind her on the stairs rang clear
through the murk; a refined voice, musical;
they always had good voices.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve had three buckets of boiling water
over the floors, and I’m going to have three
more.”
</p>

<p>
Yet another price to pay. This time not
intermittent but permanent. How long did
scrubbing last?
</p>

<p>
Though the air cleared as they mounted the
stairs, it had now a new smell, meeting and
mingling with the thinned odours coming up
from below, the smell of long-lying London
dust. A staircase window, fast shut, showed a
grimy sky. On the first floor were two rooms
standing open, their doorways close together
at right angles. The window of the large front
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
room gave a blurred view of the house-fronts
over the way. The back room was a small
square, with a square window. The sky here
was fly-blown, but less dim than from the
staircase window, and there were trees, black-stemmed,
bearing many-shaped masses of drying
leaves. A short flight led up to the second
floor. Here were the rooms, two; open doors
at right angles as on the floor below. Windows
wide, smells banished; clear clean height of
air. It was the height of the rooms that made
these narrow four-story houses look tall.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, they’re <em>nice</em> rooms,” she said.
</p>

<p>
“They’re nice old houses, they’ve been <em>good</em>
houses,” he panted plaintively. “I live next
door, with my mother. Come <em>upstairs</em>, Miss
Henderson. I’m at work up <em>there</em>.”
</p>

<p>
He went on up the narrow flight leading to
the attic. When his long form had disappeared,
Miriam turned into the large room; a large
oblong, its end wall, opposite the broad high
window, broken by a door communicating with
the back room. Going through it, she found
the smaller room dark. There was a pale wash
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
on the walls of the other room, but here a
dark old paper absorbed the light without
reflection. And the ceiling, of course, would
be dark with grime. The ceiling seemed to
have looked down at her long ago. Long she
had stood, with life gathered richly about her,
in the empty window-lit space where she now
asked whether really she had seen up there
while she welcomed this superfluous second
room, the thing that lay reflected in her mind,
growing dim, changing to a feeling, a part of
the warm sense of life all about her.
</p>

<p>
“Won’t you come up, Miss Henderson?
I’m at work up <em>here</em>.”
</p>

<p>
She had forgotten the man and the third
room. At this moment, in order not to go up,
she would have sacrificed the possession of the
third room. On her way out she glanced at
the ceiling. It <em>was</em> painted. Floating draped
figures, garlanded, in dull crimsons, faded rose
and blue and gold, dim with grime, set within
a moulding shaped to fill the angles of the
square and filmed to a yellowish brown.
</p>

<p>
“This is a nice room.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
The man, a good deal altered by a large white
apron, was standing behind his buckets.
</p>

<p>
“My name’s Sheffield. I <em>told</em> Miss Holland.
Perhaps she didn’t tell you?”
</p>

<p>
The room stated itself, competing with the
voice. It was high and airy, its ceiling sloping
on all four sides; in the front to a deep lattice,
having a wide shelf underneath.
</p>

<p>
“She’s a very nice lady. Nice <em>quiet</em> lady.
There’s not so many about nowadays.”
</p>

<p>
It was all coming back; the attitude towards
life that had so tormented her when she listened
unaided by thought. She knew now
that it was blasphemy. It is blasphemy, she
could say, if this man were equally armed,
blasphemy to imagine that each next generation
is plunging into an abyss.
</p>

<p>
“People don’t keep themselves to themselves
like they did. There’s too much running
about. Don’t you think so, Miss Henderson?”
</p>

<p>
She was looking out upon the rain-washed
parapet a yard away from the window. ‘Nice
to have a parrypidge in case of fire; plenty
of roofs and chimley-pots to walk on.’
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
“Yes,” she said hastily. “People run about
because they wonder who they are.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s it. Don’t know where they are.
That’s the position of the L.C.C. Money to
spend and must find something to spend it on.
Public money. Pitched away. Not a hayputh
o’ good out of it.”
</p>

<p>
The sudden presence in the room of the
L.C.C. made him harmless.
</p>

<p>
“Officials are strange people. Being officials
makes people strange.” She stood seeking
something that had passed wordlessly through
her mind while she snatched this borrowed
thought. Something she ought to say, hidden
because she was being insincere. It remained
hidden, and she passed towards the door, his
inferior, having nothing to offer half so good
as his own mistaken convictions.
</p>

<p>
“You going <em>down</em>, Miss Henderson?”
</p>

<p>
She was at the top of the winding stair before
she spoke the leave-taking that left the room
empty, as it would be this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Very gently she went down her stairs. In
this clear upper light, angles and surfaces declared
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
themselves intimately. The thing she
loved was there. Light falling upon the shapes
of things, reflected back, moving through the
day, a steadfast friend, silent and understanding.
She had loved it wherever she was, even
in the midst of miseries; and always it had
belonged to others. This time it was her own.
The breath she held facing it was a cool stream,
bringing strength; joy. Nothing could be
better than this. None of the events, none of
the passions of life, better than this sense of
light quietly falling.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-2">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Coming back in the afternoon, she found
Miss Holland installed, her half of the larger
room fully furnished.
</p>

<p>
From a low camp-bed with a limply frilled
Madras muslin cover, her eyes passed to a
wicker washstand-table, decked with a strip of
the same muslin and set with chilly, pimpled
white crockery. At its side was a dulled old
Windsor chair, and underneath it a battered
zinc footbath propped against the wall. Above
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
a small shabby chest of drawers a tiny square
of mirror hung by a nail to the strip of wall
next the window. No colour anywhere but
in the limp muslin, washed almost colourless.
</p>

<p>
But over the whole of the floor, gleaming,
without blemish, was the new linoleum. And
soon the dividing curtain would hang between
her and Miss Holland’s cheerless things. A
length of cord hung ready, suspended in a
deep loop from the top of the window frame
to a hook in the wall above the connecting
door, and on the floor beneath the window lay
a pile of material.
</p>

<p>
She cried out at the sight of it, bringing
Miss Holland in from the next room.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” she said disdainfully, “that is the
curtain.”
</p>

<p>
Though in the course of two meetings
Miriam had grown used to Miss Holland’s way
of speaking, it was still fruitful of wonder.
She wondered now, hearing it unchanged by
the informality of the occasion, how it had
first come into being. At Wimpole Street it
was a familiar tone, common to upper middle-class
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
dowdies of the better sort. Perhaps
Henry James used it? In men, it was apt to
be fluty; a contraction of the range of the
voice to two or three fluty notes. In women
it was almost only one note, a little curved,
breaking at some point of its passage into
distress; solicitous.
</p>

<p>
She had already discovered the exact amount
of constriction of the throat necessary to its
production, and felt it draw the muscles of her
nose and mouth into an expression of faintly
humorous contempt. Heard now, as it were
in its dressing-gown, it gave a clue to the
mode of being that would automatically produce
it; a disdain of life’s external processes,
of everything but high ends, any kind of high
end, from the honour of England to the
dignity of the speaker, that everything in life
must be moulded to serve.
</p>

<p>
Once accepted, it would ban any kind of
passionate feeling, even passionate chirpiness.
Even mirth would not be allowed to reach
beyond a faint amusement. On the whole,
so far, she had decided against it, decided that
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
it might even be possible to become a sort of
châtelaine without the constricted voice.
</p>

<p>
But on this occasion the voice showed itself
in a new light. Subtly attractive. For behind
Miss Holland’s tone was a smile that beamed
the more warmly for the frost through which
it came. It reached and touched like sunlight.
Garden sunlight that had been missing through
all the wandering years.
</p>

<p>
Did all these people emanate from high
walled gardens, scorning everything that was
outside?
</p>

<p>
In any case, here she was, indefinitely committed
to live at close quarters with a scorn
she was not sure of being able to share. Must
at least beware at the times, this was one of
them, when the châtelaine way of taking life
went to her head, of treachery to things that
stood outside it. Meanwhile the experience
would be charming. And to be a little moulded
by it would not be atavism. For Miss Holland
was more than the châtelaine. She had broken
loose, set herself in adventurous circumstances;
a châtelaine facing both ways.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
“I saw you did not like the idea of sacking,
though I think it might have been made
quite pretty, painted artistically, as I am sure
you could have done it, with a Grecian key
pattern or something of the kind, along the
border.”
</p>

<p>
She had spoken standing near the heaped
material conciliatingly, and now bent and
caught gingerly at an end, as if uncertain of
its mood.
</p>

<p>
“Still, I thought I would get this. It is the
new stuff they are calling ‘Casement cloth’
in quality rather like a fine ‘crash.’ Very
durable, and not ruinous in price.”
</p>

<p>
“Perfect. Tones with the floor and my
crocks. But you must let me pay. It’s my
extravagance.”
</p>

<p>
“Not at all. I quite like it. I shall certainly
contribute my share. Your things are here.
They are charming. I perceive that you have
excellent taste.”
</p>

<p>
“Joy, where are they?”
</p>

<p>
“I had them set down in here. I thought
you would prefer to arrange them yourself.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
She threw open the connecting door and
stood back, a gracious hostess introducing
guests. How tall she was indoors, and big.
Heavy in build, yet limber and light-footed;
graceful. The grey in the sleek dark mass of
hair scarcely showed. Her large eyes, set well
apart on either side of her good nose, when
there was no street light to show the tired
muscles round about them, were really beautiful.
Liquid radiant blue, with a darker ring.
</p>

<p>
“I suddenly,” Miriam said, going into the
crowded little room, “remembered crockery
and went back to Maple’s. But there’s a
tragedy. I forgot an indispensable.”
</p>

<p>
She was startled by laughter, an abrupt
fairy tinkle, affectionate and gay.
</p>

<p>
“Never mind,” said the voice, unchanged.
“I will obtain one for you.”
</p>

<p>
“How?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, quite easily, I assure you.”
</p>

<p>
“And, oh Lord, a pail! I forgot a pail.”
</p>

<p>
“There is no need to invoke the Deity. I
have several pails.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam turned and saw happiness shine
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
from her. Her presence was balm as she stood
so lightly there—a momentary stillness poised
for help, ready to welcome any confession,
shoulder any burden that might be offered—and
then turned on a dancing step towards the
big room, thoroughly pleased, deep, quite deep,
in delight at the prospect of settling down
here in intimacy.
</p>

<p>
And here they were. And it <em>was</em> wonderful.
Full of a deep refreshment. The experiment
was turning to success. But not yet quite
fully. Not until the curtain was up and the
strips of privacy were secure.
</p>

<p>
She was not sure that Miss Holland desired
a complete privacy. The curtain, for her, was
an affair of modesty, a physical not a spiritual
covering. Spiritually she had nothing to hide.
</p>

<p>
She had no back premises. No reservations.
And here, at last, no doubt, was the secret of
the effortless decorous speech of the “gentlewoman.”
And the secret of its tiresomely
unvarying form. The quality it expressed
went right through. They not only spoke as
they thought, but thought as they spoke,
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
guided and fashioned their thought, even to
themselves, in forms of decorous speech. Anything
that could not so be moulded was
banished. Anything “unspeakable”—their
strongest term of contempt. Thus they were,
even when alone, permanently at attention.
</p>

<p>
For herself, the coming of the curtain would
be the moment of dropping the mask of attention,
the moment of soaring freely within this
new life. Things were going ahead too fast.
Strong impressions succeeding and obliterating
each other too swiftly to be absorbed.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll go round for my things. Must find a
greengrocer,” she said, looking in on Miss
Holland cutting a slice from a substantial bar
of plain soap.
</p>

<p>
“You prefer a greengrocer? I am employing
the Church Army myself. They are most
useful. And it is quite the least expensive way
of moving. The men should now be on their
way with the last of my things. They could
then, if you like, fetch yours.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah! Perfect,” said Miriam, and set forth.
</p>

<p>
Going westwards she met a sky ablaze with
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
fiery rose thrown up behind clouds that hid
the drooping sun, and saw, looking back, the
London scene transformed; pink houses, grey
roofs tinged with madder. The sun had still
a good way to drop. The clouds might shift.
Coming back she would walk in brilliance.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-3">

<p class="noindent">
The Church Army men arrived as she was
putting together the last of her things.
</p>

<p>
They were oppressive. Met in the freedom
of a slum they would have been dreadful
enough. But with their prison air of sullen
shyness, overlaid by an ill-fitting respectability
they were, she felt as she stood telling them
what things were to be removed, heart-breaking
by reason of their ignorance of the world
they now feared. They did not know that the
evil that in them had come up and out into
action was in everybody.
</p>

<p>
She wanted to fête them, give them tea,
somehow make them cease tiptoeing about
the room with that dreadful air of shame.
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
But her voice, which she tried to make casual,
sounded rallying, expressive of equality, insulting;
she could only wish them to finish
and be gone.
</p>

<p>
Her forgotten book was lying on the table.
The book that had suddenly become the centre
of her life. Now, with these men here, the
very existence of the volume seemed a mockery.
She took it in her hands, felt it draw her again
with its unique power. The men could, must,
manage without supervision. For the second
time, during which they stood listening as
though she had not spoken before, she pointed
out the things which were to be taken, and
sat down with the book.
</p>

<p>
Sitting thus with the book in her hands and
her eyes upon the title, set within the golden
lines of an upright oblong in letters of gold
upon the red cover, she found herself back
within the first moment of meeting it. In the
little book-shop, a treasure house opened by
the so small subscription. Saw again the close-packed
ranks of well-known names, names that
had until then, whenever she thought of them,
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
stood large along the margin of life, and that
seemed now, set minutely down upon neat
rows of volumes, suddenly uninteresting, irrelevant
to the impulse of her search. And then
this book, for all the neutrality of its title and
of the author’s name, drawing her hands,
bringing as she took it from the shelf and
carried it, unexamined, away down the street,
the stillness of contentment.
</p>

<p>
She could, so long as the men remained, get
no further. Within the neat red binding lay
altogether new happiness. But she was aware
only of the sluggishly moving men, of the
shelter from whence they had come and whither
presently, when she, free and a millionaire,
should have been shifted from palace to palace,
they would, with their dingy barrow, shamble
back.
</p>

<p>
The men were going downstairs. The last
moments in this room that held the whole of
her London life were ticking themselves away,
appealing in vain for some sadness of farewell.
Just round the corner in Flaxman’s Court was
Miss Holland, expectantly at work. And here
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
she sat with a book open upon her knee,
asking only to be left in communion with a
style.
</p>

<p>
She glanced through the pages of its opening
chapter, the chapter that was now part of her
own experience; set down at last alive, so
that the few pages stood in her mind, growing
as a single good day will grow, in memory,
deep and wide, wider than the year to which
it belongs. She was surprised to find, coming
back after the interval of disturbed days, how
little she had read. Just the opening pages,
again and again, not wanting to go forward;
wanting the presentation of the two men,
talking outside time and space in the hotel
bedroom, to go on for ever. And presently
fearing to go on, lest the perfection of satisfaction
should cease.
</p>

<p>
Reading a paragraph here and there, looking
out once more the two phrases that had
thrilled her more intimately than any others,
she found a stirring of strange statements in
her mind. A strange clarity that was threatening
to change the adventure of reading to a
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
shared disaster. For she remembered now,
having hung for a while over Waymarsh’s
“sombre glow” and “his attitude of prolonged
impermanence,” that she had already
read on into the next chapter, that something
had happened, so bitter as to have been pushed
from her mind. And yet her mind had been
at work upon it. It had happened with the
coming of Maria Gostrey, and had culminated
at the dinner-party in her red neck-band.
Disappointing. Yes. Here she was again,
drawing on her gloves and being elaborately
mysterious.
</p>

<p>
The thought, too, of reading in the new
room with Miss Holland on the other side of
the curtain, changed the proportions of the
adventure. Made it almost improper. She
imagined herself trying to explain why the
phrases that lit the scene were wonderful.
And it seemed, thought of as a public matter,
ridiculous to have been so excited by the way
he conveyed information without coming forward
to announce it. But even more disquieting
was Miss Holland’s reinforcement of
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
the need to confront the author with his own
cynicism, to tell him that in every word he
came forward with his views, which were the
most hopelessly complacent masculine ignorance.
</p>

<p>
It was only as private, shared by no one else,
that the adventure was glorious. Thought of
as carried under the eye of a witness, it seemed
criminal—“anti-social.” She now for the first
time imagined men reading the magic pages,
suffering unconsciously their insidious corruption.
This man was a monstrous unilluminated
pride. And joy in him was a mark of the same
corruption. Pride in discovering the secrets
of his technique. Pride in watching it labour
with the development of the story. The deep
attention demanded by this new way of statement
was in itself a self-indulgence. Thought
of as enjoyed in a world that held Church
Army men it was plain wickedness.
</p>

<p>
But the cold ignorance of this man was
unconscious. And therefore innocent. And
it was he after all who had achieved the first
completely satisfying way of writing a novel.
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
If this were a novel. There <em>was</em> something
holy about it. Something to make, like Conrad,
the heavens rejoice. Perhaps at lunch times,
or in rare solitudes, she could go on, get at the
whole of the light there was in him. Style
was something beyond good and evil. Sacred
and innocent.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-4">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The new furniture peopled the room with
clear reflections. The daylight was dimmed
by the street, but it came in generously through
the wide high window. And upon the polished
surfaces of the little bureau, set down with
its back to the curtain, and upon its image,
filling the lower part of the full-length strip
of mirror hung opposite against the wall, were
bright plaques of open sky.
</p>

<p>
The bureau was experience; seen from any
angle it was joy complete. Added to life and
independent of it. A little thing that would
keep its power through all accidents of mood
and circumstance. The inlaid design enclosing
the lock of the sloping lid formed a triangle
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
with the small brass candlesticks at either end
of the level top, and the brass handles of the
three drawers hung below on either side,
garlands, completing the decoration.
</p>

<p>
Pools of light rested on the squat moss-green
crockery of the wash-table, set, flanked by clear
wall and clear green floor, between the mirror
and the end of the small bed which skirted the
wall as far as the door opening on to the landing.
The unencumbered floor made a green
pathway to the window. It was refreshment
merely to walk along it, between clean sightly
objects. Squalor was banished. No more
smell of dust. No more sleepless nights under
a roof too hot to grow cool even in the hour
before dawn. Here in the mornings there
would always be beauty, the profiles of
things growing clear on either side of the
pathway of morning light, the profiles of
flowers, set in a bowl between the sentinel
candlesticks.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland’s voice came unheralded,
startlingly out of the silence. She must have
come through from the back room in noiseless
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
slippers. Miriam answered that she had
forgotten about clothes, and proposed nails in
the attic.
</p>

<p>
“It will be no trouble at all. I have lengths
of bamboo and still some yards of green
material. We will regard any provision of
French wardrobes down here as franking me
to use the attic for my charts and other
impedimenta. You, I observe, have no
débris.”
</p>

<p>
“Only a few books.”
</p>

<p>
“You have a goodly store of books. I shall
look forward to a treat.”
</p>

<p>
“There’s a book I’m reading now—” she
began walking up and down the linoleum path
in the excitement of wondering whether Miss
Holland could be brought to share the adventure.
</p>

<p>
“It is in a way the most wonderful I have
met. The most real.”
</p>

<p>
“No doubt you are a connoisseur.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m not. But I’ve never got so much out
of a novel before. I say, this stuff shows
every mark.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
Miss Holland would get nothing from
James. She would read patiently for a while
and pronounce him “a little tedious.”
</p>

<p>
“It will at first. But you need not be concerned
about that. I am at home all day,
and it will be a very slight matter to keep things
more or less in order. Perhaps we can make a
little bargain. I for my part will willingly
undertake the rooms and the marketing if
you will save me from the <em>palavering</em>.”
</p>

<p>
“Will there be any?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, for example, the rent. The landlord
is a most <em>odious</em> man. I abhor the thought
of tackling him. You, I am sure, will manage
anything of that sort better than I. Yes.
Most certainly. You have an air.”
</p>

<p>
A few words weekly seemed a small price to
pay for freedom from the mysteries of cleaning
and catering, and Miriam agreed to pay
the rent, to call next door and pay it; keeping
Sheffield away from the house.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland went on talking as if to herself.
Expostulating. It was a mistake, she
concluded, to drop domesticity. She preferred
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
to keep her hand in, while safeguarding
sufficient leisure for reading and so on.
</p>

<p>
Miriam saw her keeping house, dressmaking,
and yet free to wander abroad in the sunlight,
and to come home, full of the life and brightness
of London, to rest and read, with her
feet up, “to counteract the strain upon the
heart, of the upright posture” following the
example of “those sensible Americans who
discuss business with their feet on the mantelshelf.”
She judged unconventionalities according
as they did or did not serve the cause
of hygiene.
</p>

<p>
“Much” she finished hurriedly, as if to
avoid further postponing anything Miriam
might be going to say, “<em>Much</em> can be done
with a damp duster.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam wondered whether, after all, housework
might not hold some strange charm.
Something that was lacking in a life lived
altogether in the world of men; altogether
on the surface of things. Always, in relation
to household women, she felt herself a man.
Felt that they included her with a half-contemptuous
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
indulgence, in the world of men.
Some of them, those to whom the man’s
world was still an exciting mystery, were a
little jealous and spiky.
</p>

<p>
As if encouraged by silence, Miss Holland
pursued her theme.
</p>

<p>
“I have a horror of becoming an <em>official</em>
woman. It is, I think, a most obnoxious type.
It abounds. In London it is to be met wherever
women are in positions of responsibility.
Real or fancied. And it is on the increase.
There have, of course, always been official
women. Even in rural districts, where, most
unfortunately, they have but one sphere of
activity. We used to call them the curates-in-charge.”
</p>

<p>
Vicarage humour at first hand. Miriam
laughed suitably; ensconced, an eavesdropper.
</p>

<p>
“Church workers.”
</p>

<p>
“They are the bane of a parish. Work, yes.
That they most certainly do, to the accompaniment
of loud complaints on the score of other
people’s inactivity. Implying, of course, that
they themselves hold a monopoly of intelligence
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
and efficiency. Whereas the truth is to
be found in their inability to attract helpers
or to collaborate with those who really desire
to take part in the work. These women are
actuated solely by personal ambition, the desire
to run the parish and to be openly recognised
as doing so. Nothing less will content
them. Nothing less. It is a <em>most</em> perturbing
spectacle. And I, for one, have no hesitation
in admitting that I am driven to the conclusion
that authority is harmful to women. They
grow so <em>hard</em>. So <em>coldly</em> self-important and
dictatorial.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam knew she would want to run the
parish, choose the music, edit the vicar’s mind,
lecture the parishioners.
</p>

<p>
“In London many of them are social
workers. They spend their time on committees.
But not in service. They quell.”
</p>

<p>
She handled her statements as she had
handled the pile of green material, pouncing,
taking disdainful hold. Her sentences were
sallies, each one leaving her voice halted on an
interval of deprecating sounds. Her voice
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
came from a height. She must be standing,
poised, in her light way, for movement. Talking
as if to herself, assuming a lack of interest.
Yet the air was full of her shy desire for
response.
</p>

<p>
“They must be holy terrors.”
</p>

<p>
“I fear,” chuckled Miss Holland, “that
I am not completely convinced of their
holiness.”
</p>

<p>
“I’ve never met any of these women.
Avoid women on the whole. But I daresay I
should be that type myself if I weren’t too
lazy to achieve a position.”
</p>

<p>
“Believe me, you could never be official.
You are much too artistic.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam was too disappointed to feel flattered.
There was no illumination here. Exposing herself
before the tribunal, she had been judged
in a class of which the judge knew nothing.
Compared to Miss Holland, she might perhaps
be called artistic. But it was grievous to be
supplied already with a false reputation. To
be imagined as cultured in a way that was
respected in vicarages.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
She glanced around upon the poor things
that already she loved with an immemorial
love whose secret eluded her, whose going
forth she knew to be blind and personal. Her
eye was at once arrested by a small dark something
upon the white coverlet of her bed. A
ladybird. Too square. Perfectly square and
motionless. Even as she called to Miss Holland
to come through and observe, the sight of it
thrilled her in every nerve.
</p>

<p>
A swish of the curtain and Miss Holland
was at her side, bent and peering.
</p>

<p>
“Dear, dear, <em>dear</em>!” she moaned. “I
feared, I <em>feared</em>. I’ll get the dustpan.”
</p>

<p>
The floor rocked with her swift departure.
Miriam stood fascinated. The unspeakable
thing had revealed itself, and she was not only
calm but curious. A moment ago it had
existed only in her mind, an ultimate she could
not imagine herself seeing and surviving. It
looked like a fragment of an autumn leaf. Miss
Holland’s voice sounded in the further room.
Miriam listened to the low tones for entertainment
while she kept watch.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
“I feared, I feared,” and then a swift ferretting,
drowning the anxious monologue.
</p>

<p>
Weary of the scene that was holding up her
installation, she turned away to the window,
half expecting to be leapt upon from behind.
She was vitalised by the incident; tingling
from head to foot. It was strange that one
could recognise at sight an unknown thing;
but far stranger that within a moment of pure
shock there should be life, the keen sense of
living that stood away outside the bounds of
everyday life.
</p>

<p>
What a set of circumstances were these that
brought only vermin to give her the pang of
immortality. Not a thing one could testify
at a dinner-table. Why not?
</p>

<p>
When Miss Holland came back she would
remind her that monkeys were timid, and
fearful of small creeping things. Being a
Protestant she probably revelled in Evolution—wouldn’t
see that it left everything more
spooky than before.
</p>

<p>
She was looking straight in at a window of
the opposite house. The panes were clean and
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
clear, the curtains on either side a dull dark
green, hanging in straight folds. Sombre.
Faintly, clearer as she made it out, a thick tall
white candle rose in the midst of the gloom,
just inside the window, changing the aspect of
the curtains, making a picture. Just visible,
right and left, were the shoulders of two high-backed
chairs. She imagined them occupied,
the beam of the thick white candle falling on
two forms. But in this street what forms?
It was clear that she and Miss Holland were
not the only aliens. Perhaps “artistic”
bachelor women who made a cult of their
diggings, wore sage-green dresses and would
emerge to become a spectacle known by heart,
now both together, now one alone, crying
cultured witticisms from the street to the
window. Women standing critically aside from
life, hugely amused by it. But would such
have achieved that candle, at once a person
and a piece of furniture? Lamps they would
have, with art shades. Or if candles, still
art shades. It might be an anchorite.
But the company of such a candle was
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
not solitude. Underneath the window was
a cobbler’s shop.
</p>

<p>
“Just look here,” she cried to Miss Holland
coming back preceded by her voice. The
things in her own room seemed to greet, as she
turned, the things in the room across the way.
It was a man’s room. It had an air of waiting
for an untimed return.
</p>

<p>
“I hope,” said Miss Holland, through a rapid
scrunching of paper. “I trust, it was only
those Church Army men.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam watched her go away, with the dustpan
at arm’s length, still gravely expostulating.
</p>

<p>
“It’s dreadful,” she said to her returning
form, “but also fearfully funny, to find the
ultimate horror sitting contentedly, poor little
thing, on the end of your bed.”
</p>

<p>
She tinkled and tinkled at that, woefully
crying out through her laughter, repudiating
and agreeing and contradicting.
</p>

<p>
“But I admire your spirit,” she wailed
finally.
</p>

<p>
“Do look at this huge candle across the
way.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
Miss Holland moved to her side and peered
anxiously, frowning in anticipation.
</p>

<p>
“Very odd,” she said sceptically. “A ship’s
candle, something of the kind.”
</p>

<p>
“Where did they get it? Besides, too tall,
it would burn a cabin roof. Perhaps an altar
candle.”
</p>

<p>
“Very eccentric.” She turned away, busily,
skittishly. Pleased about something, but not
interested in the candle.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-5">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Her light busy footfall was audible upstairs
as Miriam faced the boxes and parcels waiting,
piled amongst the furniture of the little back
room, to be unpacked.... With Sunday at
hand it would never occur to Miss Holland to
leave it all and go out. But she too must be
wanting tea. There could be tea, now, amongst
the wreckage. Laughter and relaxation.
</p>

<p>
Yet not to go out now was to miss so much.
To go out, leaving behind this treasure of disorder,
and sit at leisure in an undisturbed world,
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
would be to reap the full adventure of being
installed. Homekeeping people missed that
adventure. They slaved on and on, saying
how nice it will be when everything is
<em>straight</em>. And then wondered why it was
not nice.
</p>

<p>
Left to herself, she would now go out, not
only for tea but for the whole evening, into a
world renewed. There would be one of those
incidents that punctually present themselves at
such moments, a link in the chain of life as it
appears only when one is cut off from fixed
circumstances. She would come home lost and
refreshed. Laze through Sunday morning.
Roam about the rooms amongst things askew
as though thrown up by an earthquake, their
exposed strata storied with memory and
promise. There would be indelible hours of
reading and dreaming, of harvesting the lively
thought that comes when one is neither here
nor there, but poised in bright light between
a life ended and a life not yet begun. The
blissful state would last until dusk deepened
towards evening and would leave her filled
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
with a fresh realisation of the wonder of being
alive and in the midst of life, and with strength
to welcome the week slowly turning its unknown
bright face towards her through the
London night. With great speed, at the
eleventh hour, she would get everything
roughly in order.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland appeared at the sitting-room
door, eyeing the disorder.
</p>

<p>
Miriam groaned her fatigue aloud.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s leave it,” said Miss Holland, contemptuously.
“Oh, let’s <em>leave</em> it,” she wailed
in a protesting falsetto, with averted face and
outstretched fingers disgustedly flipping.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s drop everything and go out for tea,”
she went on, relaxing, looking into space, while
with eyebrows raised disdainfully she stood
halted for response.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, agreed,” said Miriam. “I’m expiring.”
</p>

<p>
“We will <em>not</em> expire. We will seek tea
<em>immediately</em>.”
</p>

<p>
She swung round on one heel and bounded
lightly back into the bedroom with her tinkling
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
laugh. The little scene remained in Miriam’s
eyes, somewhere within it the exchanged glance
of delighted understanding that had driven
them both to cover which was not cover, for
they were immediately together again, and the
dividing curtain could not mask the results of
their encounter, the quick movements, the
duet of cheerful hummings.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-6">

<p class="noindent">
Miriam went back into the little room to
collect her outdoor things; checking an impulse
to eager snatching, steadying herself
against the sudden arrival of the personal
note.
</p>

<p>
Under her hat was the red book. The <em>personal
note</em> repeated itself before her mind’s eye,
in print. And as she searched for her gloves
the note described itself as it were aloud, in a
voice speaking urbanely from the surrounding
air. Its indubitable descent; its perhaps too
great and withal so manifestly, so well-nigh
woefully irretrievable precipitancy. Its so
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
charming and for all she could at the moment
and within the straitly beleaguering the so
eminently onerous and exciting circumstances
assemble of disturbing uncertainty, so brilliantly,
so almost <em>dazzlingly</em> sunlit height. In
simpler words, things were going too fast
and too far. An exact and dramatic landscape
of thought. Things seen as going too
fast and too far, distilled into refinement.
Cuyp.
</p>

<p>
She tried to imagine herself producing
phrases for the landlord from a mental landscape
of what would be occurring between
them in terms of thought. It would certainly
make her dignified, and to the landlord,
mysterious. It might daunt, reduce him, keep
him at a distance. But it was difficult to weave
in the word “rent” the so simple, the so
potently humiliating monosyllable that was
the immediate, the actual, the dreadfully unavoidable
... ornate alias. Ah. Clifford
Allbutt. James was the art of beautifully
elaborating the ornate alias?
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-7">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Her eyes roamed as she moved about putting
on her things. Seeking up and down the strip
of bedroom for a centre, some running together
of effects where her spirit could settle and find
its known world about it. There seemed to
be none, though the light was fading and the
aspect of the room as it had been when her
things were first set down was already in the
past. Each glance produced the same picture;
a picture seen and judged long ago and with
which her eyes could do nothing. She took
refuge with single objects, finding each satisfactory,
but nowhere reaching home. Swimming
in transparent shallows, unable to touch
bottom, stand steady, and see forth. Her life
had somehow ceased. Behind her back unawares,
while she had flown from newness to
newness, its thread had been snapped. The
small frayed end remaining in her hand was
drawing her <a id="corr-1"></a>ahead across a level that showed no
coverts; no deep places to be invaded by unsummoned
dreams and their good end in the
recreation of familiar things.

Though it was late when they arrived, the
club was just as she had seen it on her first
solitary visit. The same hush in the large
drawing-room, the same low murmuring of
conversation between women half hidden in
the depths of easy-chairs.
</p>

<p>
Seated in two little high-backed chairs by
the central window, they found themselves
looking down on the square, a small forest dim
in the twilight, asheen where the light poured
in from the street lamps. A twilit loveliness
at rest. Walked through, the squares were
always a new loveliness, but even at a stroll
they passed too quickly. There, at last, was
one of the best of them arrested for contemplation.
</p>

<p>
Away behind was a roomful of independent
strangers, also aware of the square
set ever before their eyes. This was freedom,
in company, enriched. The sense of imprisonment
she had felt on coming down the street
with Miss Holland, the tangible confirmation
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
when Miss Holland, laughter sounding in the
tones of her confidently talking voice, suddenly
took her arm, of the note struck too soon, and
too high, vanished altogether in the freedom
of this neutral territory.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland was responding formally, in
low tones, to her comments on the aspect of
the square. Spontaneity it was evident was to
be shelved just where it might be safely indulged;
just where one attained an impersonality
as wide as the wide world.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she found herself wanting to say
outrageous things. The decorous voices sounding
all about her seemed to call for violence.
With difficulty she kept her tone subdued.
Level it refused to be. The gift of the square
imparted to every word the sound of exciting
news. News upon which the dear, the for-the-first-time-so-comfortably,
so-opulently-visible
London twilight closed gently in.
</p>

<p>
It was to a morning and not to Miss Holland
she was speaking. The wide deep spaces of a
London Sunday morning that showed invariably
within the witnessed falling of a Saturday
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
twilight. Miss Holland’s responses showed her
struggling between charmed appreciation and
a sense that audible comments were not quite
within the boundaries of club etiquette.
Silence fell, and within it Miriam saw the
scales of judgment descend equally balanced.
She had, it was true, given no thought to her
neighbours and only now in retrospect heard
her lively tones penetrate the murmurings of
the gathered ladies. But—she was wearing
her lavender-grey, her mushroom hat of silky
straw, both still quite able to hold their own,
and still conquering fatigue whenever she put
them on. While Miss Holland, though clothed
in awareness of her surroundings, was not even
stylishly dowdy. Piled upon her head was a
mass of blue crinoline, not only faded, but
dulled with inextricable dust. Beneath its
shapelessness wisps of lank hair made fun of
her dignified bearing. A black tie, running
from neck to waist of the skimped blouse
uniting her coat and skirt, fought with the
millinery hat. Only her eyes took the light,
and they were at a loss, turned unseeing, under
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
faintly frowning brows, upon the prospect
beyond the window.
</p>

<p>
She was uneasy, disapproving equally of
silence and of speech that was not smoothly
decorous.
</p>

<p>
Tea came. Lights went up all over the
room; brilliant light shone down upon the
stately Queen Anne service, shone through the
thinness of the shallow flowered cups.
</p>

<p>
“Tea,” cried Miriam, through the shifting
of chairs that followed the coming of the
light, “should never be drunk from cold
white cups.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland laughed her laugh, and began
with large, composed movements to pour out.
At once her appearance was redeemed. For a
moment Miriam sat basking in her manner.
Then her eyes were drawn to two tall figures
risen together from deep chairs far away.
</p>

<p>
“One ought,” she went on to lend a casual
air to her first inspection of fellow-members,
“to drink down to a pattern.” They were
without hats and therefore residents. And
unexpectedly impressive.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
“Good faience,” Miss Holland was saying,
“is certainly a great enhancement of the charm
of the tea-table.”
</p>

<p>
They were most strange. They radiated a
definitely familiar quality as they stood there
gazing down the room. At nothing. There
was no trace of the awareness of exposure that
set the faces of the women sitting about within
view, large-hatted in deep chairs; awareness
or careful unawareness. Yet as they moved,
now, slowly along the clear spaces of the room,
they were visibly the figures of an ordeal.
Stately in their white-robed splendour, they
were still piteous. Something was dispelling
the conventional charm usually inseparable
from the spectacle of beauty, tall and well-clothed,
moving slowly through a room.
</p>

<p>
The depth of her interest inspired Miriam
to feed her conversation with Miss Holland
and remain at the same time free to watch.
The mystery cleared as the figures drew near.
They were sisters, the one quite ordinary, fully
aware and fitted out with the regulation
feminine charm of bearing. Conscious of piled
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
brown hair, of brilliant oval cheeks, of dark and
lively eyes. The upturning bow of her mouth
was set in a smile. So it would be set, thought
Miriam, years ahead, when the nose and the
chin began to approach each other. She was
the elder. But her few extra years, the ardour
of her head and her splendid form, were in
leash to the being of the other. She it was
who came unseeing and produced the strange
effect. Slender, in childish muslin beside her
sister’s opulent sophisticated lace, she was
formidable. Below her dark hair, drawn flat
to the shape of her head, yet set round it like
a mist, was the strong calm face of a healthy
child, a mask clear of expression and colourless
but for the eyes that were startling. Life
flowed from her eyes as if it would wither the
air before them. Where was she? Whence,
round-faced child, had she gathered her
wealth of suffering? Her beauty was the
beauty of a transfiguration. Here, on this
plain afternoon, at the Belmont, amongst
friends.
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly, as they came quite near, Miriam
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
averted her screened gaze and met the eyes of
the other. Here was conciliation, a deprecating
fearfulness changing suddenly as she came in
view of Miss Holland.
</p>

<p>
“My,” she vowed, wide-mouthed for the
leisurely vowel, “it’s Miss Halland.”
</p>

<p>
Americans! Then perhaps the other girl
merely had neuralgia. Miss Holland had
turned, and Miriam saw her swift disclaiming
glance and its change into the shy but brightly
charmed and charming smile, accompanying
the greeting that was yet so formal and in
its apologetic disdainfulness so like her voice.
She was hidden now behind the tall white
figures. Their voices, playing about her and
expanding into the room, killed Miriam’s interest.
There was, for her, something in the
American voice that robbed its communications
of any depth of meaning. The very ease
of their talk, its expressiveness, the direct swift
way they handled their stores of information
and communicated their thoughts, made even
the most fascinating topics fall dead, rifled of
essential significance.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Her stranded attention was caught by the
sound of blended voices approaching from the
door. Voices in the midst of talk, having come
into the room talking, but not in the least in
the English way of making conversation to
cover an entry. They were in full swing, their
sentences overlapping. Obviously noticing
nothing and no one. They were using the
club as a place to talk in, and were one voice.
Sisters or cousins. Yet they had arranged
themselves in chairs without breaking their
talk, which went forward so eagerly that they
seemed to be exchanging opinions for the first
time. Now where had she heard, between
sisters, exactly that effect? Somewhere between
members of a large family that formed
a society in itself?
</p>

<p>
No, the three Bannerman girls, just three,
no more, living in seclusion with their parents,
marching about all over Barnes for years,
in perpetual conversation in high, rapid
voices....
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
They had suddenly appeared at the church
decorations, keeping it up even there, amongst
themselves. Speaking to no one else. Being
really interested, but somehow conveying their
conviction that the people all around them
were too stupid even to be noticed. They had
accepted work politely, making clever comments
without looking at those who instructed
them, and then sat there with quickly moving
fingers and a ceaseless fretting of voices.
Always one shape of tone: beginning on a
refined argumentative switchback of sound.
Harriett had caught it, taking them off, for
days.
</p>

<p>
“Isn’t it verray re<em>mar</em>kable, my dear Miriam,
that such a singularly tall man as Mr. Spiffkins
should be a radical?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t you, my dear Miriam, consider it
highly alarming that rain falls <em>down</em> instead
of up?”
</p>

<p>
She listened. Here, perhaps, as the Bannermans
now appeared in her mind for the first
time since she left home, would be light upon
that long-forgotten mystery. But a question
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
intruded. Why, since their voices followed the
same pattern of sound and bore the same suggestion
of being at loggerheads with the social
order, why had not the Lycurgans recalled the
Bannerman girls? Certainly if they were alive
and in London, all three were now active members
of the Lycurgan society; the amused
superiority in their voices added to the Lycurgan
tide of amused superiority to everything
on earth.
</p>

<p>
Yet these women who had brought them
back, though they had the Lycurgan voice,
had nothing of the crisp cocksureness of the
socialist intelligentsia. They were unanimously
belabouring someone, hitting out right
and left, but within their expressive voices,
moulding their lively scorn, animating the
unvarying tone-shape of the intelligentsia-in-argument,
was <em>sorrow</em>.
</p>

<p>
The coming of their tea brought a pause.
With the ceasing of their voices warmth withdrew
from the sound of the room, and returned
at the first phrase sounding together with the
cheerful gush of tea hurriedly poured.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
“Well, I think it’s just simply incomprehensible.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam knew it was not. She half turned,
strangely sure that they would welcome her
and quite simply state a case. They were not
a clique. Something in their voices related
them to everybody in the world. They had
the selflessness of those who keep an eye everywhere,
without discrimination of persons.
They would be at once interested, even in herself,
and quite blind. She turned and found
a group of three, three small women with one
face; a face she knew well at Lycurgan meetings
and liked, but always with a queer thrill
of uncertainty. It was vital, intimately intelligent,
and yet alien, seeming at once to light up
and to darken its surroundings.
</p>

<p>
The club, she thought as she turned gladly
back to the loneliness created by Miss Holland’s
surrounded state, was going to get hold of her
in a way of which she had never dreamed,
since at the outset it had brought her to the
edge of the whirlpool of people with whom
this dark face was in her mind so richly associated.
<a id="page-59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
Set in a row of Lycurgan faces, all
screened, more or less, in the English way and
not different, in silence, from a row of Primrose
League faces, this one face would stand
out, a pale, bony oval set with crisp hair; and
eyes, under dark brows, richly despairingly
intent. The moment the lecture was over it
would be visible, now here now there, and
always in eager speech.
</p>

<p>
Small wonder, since it turned out to be three,
that she was always seeing it.
</p>

<p>
“Now Mrs. Wilson <em>is</em> charming,” said one.
“A far more charming personality than he.”
</p>

<p>
However indiscreet, the remark was illuminating.
Set up thus on a placard she need
have no hesitation in carrying it away, for
Hypo. But she must acknowledge the receipt
of it. Turning full round, she met a vivid
face that boldly smiled, and, smiling, was
drowned in a vivid flush. Miriam smiled too,
basking for a moment in the charm, glowing
so brightly in its rôle of a prolonged haunting
impression come suddenly to life at her elbow.
But so formidably. In place of one figure a
<a id="page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
whole group, a multiplicity of attraction. She
turned away to find the white figures had
disappeared.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-1-10">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Miss Holland sat, flushed with talk, quietly
but quite evidently summoning composure;
as nearly flustered as it was possible for her
to be.
</p>

<p>
“How tall those women are,” said Miriam,
still intent on the group behind.
</p>

<p>
“I did not introduce them,” replied Miss
Holland, busying herself, with downcast eyes,
amongst the flowered tea-cups. “I—well—I
thought——” her deprecating tone collapsed
into a murmur and rose again, recovering.
“Yes, they are tall, both mother and
daughter.”
</p>

<p>
“Astounding. I thought they were sisters.”
</p>

<p>
“Their name is Wheeler. It is a most interesting
story.”
</p>

<p>
Nothing about Americans could be really
interesting. But Miss Holland, without looking
up, was launched upon her narrative.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>
“They are from San Antonio in Texas.
The child Estella is just fifteen years of age.
Yes, it is remarkable. A warmer clime, I suppose.
Still it is very remarkable. Her grandmother
was Spanish. And that perhaps may
account for her exceptional temperament.
She is a musician. The ’cello. They have
travelled to London for her training. It seems
that her teachers at home were obliged to
confess they could do nothing further for
her.”
</p>

<p>
“Why not Germany?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, that is just it. The reason for their
coming to London is the strangest part of the
story. It seems that there is a Pole, a celebrated
’cellist. The child heard him once,
years ago, in New York, and has been saying
ever since that he is the only man in the world
who can teach her. He, it appears, is giving
performances in London this winter. So they
have come. The child thinks of nothing else.
For the moment she is at the Philharmonic
Academy. She dislikes it. I am sincerely sorry
for her mother. She is most courageous; and
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
so wise. Insists on physical culture. Very
wise. Skipping and so on. At a gymnasium.
The great trouble at the moment is that it
now appears that the Pole takes no pupils.
Also that they are not too well off. Estella,
however, is determined to see him.”
</p>

<p>
“Has she given concerts?”
</p>

<p>
“Not so far. But the Academy wishes to
bring her out. At the Queen’s Hall.”
</p>

<p>
“Wicked!”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly she is young.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland hesitated. She was evidently
still full of communications about the Wheelers,
but suddenly unwilling to continue. She was
guarding them. Miriam saw plainly that her
interest was not to go too far. That, she felt,
was all to the good. Here was the beginning
of an understanding that their interests were
to be independent. But the possessiveness and
the mystery was making her dislike these
Wheelers. They had Miss Holland’s interest
in a way she was sure she would never do, and
Miss Holland was admitting it and saying too,
with her honest embarrassment, that she believed
<a id="page-63" class="pagenum" title="63"></a>
these wonderful people would not be
interested in her fellow-lodger.
</p>

<p>
She was her fellow-lodger. Now that personal
depths had been revealed, that strange
fact remained; an achievement.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">iriam</span> sat through the evening reading
by lamplight in the disorderly little
room. Unsatisfactorily. Her attention wandered
to Miss Holland lecturing in the East
End, and to the thoughts in Miss Holland’s
mind as she stood confronted by the roomful
of dilapidated people.
</p>

<p>
The shaded lamplight left everything in
gloom but the page whose words, yesterday so
potent, brought to-night only a sense of the
gulf between life and the expression of it.
She had reached the conclusion that fiction
was at worst a highly flavoured drug and at
best as much an abstraction as metaphysics,
when Miss Holland came back.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-2-2">
2
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
She stood in the doorway tall and dim; silent
and dubious with fatigue. But when Miriam
<a id="page-65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>
suggested going out in search of coffee she came
to life in horrified resistance, announced her
belief in the restorative power of weak tea, and
vowed that not on any account would she issue
forth without good cause at such an hour.
</p>

<p>
And out in the blue-lit gloom of the Euston
Road, hurrying timidly along, she still protested.
But behind her woeful protests was
delight. And once they were safely inside the
heavily frosted inner doors and the little
padrone, as Miriam had predicted, came forward
to welcome them, and waving away a
hovering waiter, himself found them places
and took their small order, she sat back upon
her red velvet sofa evidently enjoying the
adventure. But beyond a single comprehensive
glance, she had not noticed her surroundings.
She remarked upon the cleanliness, the
cheerful Alpine oleographs. Of all the rest
she was unaware.
</p>

<p>
To have her here, disarmed of her fears, was
not enough. But even if they came again and
again there would never be more than that.
She would never expand to the atmosphere.
<a id="page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
Would always sit as she was doing now, upright
and insulated, making formal conversation;
decorously busy with the small meal.
</p>

<p>
The place was not crowded. Everyone there
was distinctly visible—the lonely intent women
in gaudy finery, the old men fêting bored,
laughing girls who glanced about; the habitués,
solitary figures in elderly bondage to the
resources of the place.
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” said Miriam at last, “there
are all sorts of queer people here.”
</p>

<p>
She sat back, unwilling to go, looking out
into the room as if unaware of Miss Holland’s
preparations to depart, following immediately
on her last sip of the excellent coffee. But
supposing Miss Holland should even for a
moment sit back and contemplate her surroundings?
She would see only material for
pity or disgust. See only morally. Her interest
in individuals would be an uninteresting
interest. That young man, with his pose of
careful conscious detachment would not for
her be any kind of epitome, but just a young
man—“probably some sort of student.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
“It is now,” said Miss Holland, glancing at
her wrist-watch, “well past midnight. This
has been a unique experience. And, just for
this once, I do not object to it. But it must
certainly not be repeated.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam gazed at her. She was blushing.
She had seen all that there was to see. Miriam
remembered her own first horror. But that
had been alone and in youthful ignorance.
</p>

<p>
“I’m sorry you don’t like my little haunt.”
</p>

<p>
“It is scarcely that. The place is clean and
pleasant and doubtless a great convenience to
many people. But, dear me, dear me, I can
only imagine the horror of my chief in beholding
me sitting here, and at such an hour.”
</p>

<p>
Astonishment kept Miriam dumb and passed
into resentment. Having delivered her judgment,
Miss Holland now sat contemptuously
drawing on her gloves. The episode over and
escape at hand, she released a scorn that was
almost venomous. It lingered about her
politely smiling relief, an abominable look of
triumph. Of personal triumph.
</p>

<p>
Miriam clung to her silence. She felt the
<a id="page-68" class="pagenum" title="68"></a>
advantage fall to her own side as she saw Miss
Holland’s acceptance of her unspoken thoughts.
</p>

<p>
“It is different for yourself,” she said in
answer to them. “You are free from the
necessity of considering appearances.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m a guttersnipe, thank Heaven,” said
Miriam.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland laughed. A small sound incapable
of reaching the next table. She was
really amused.
</p>

<p>
“You are anything but that. And in certain
respects you may consider yourself fortunate.”
</p>

<p>
Donizetti’s had been insulted. At sight of
Miss Holland hurrying with bent head, as if
weathering a gale of contamination, down the
aisle between the rows of little tables, Miriam
hated her. Hated her refusal to place herself
outside the pale of feminine dignity. The
narrow pale. Deep. But were they deep,
these people who went about considering their
dignity? “Dignity is absurdity,” she vowed,
keeping step with Miss Holland’s light swift
walk.
</p>

<p>
There is one thing worse than a dignified
<a id="page-69" class="pagenum" title="69"></a>
man and that is an undignified woman.
Chesterton. It sounded so respectful; chivalrous.
Made me try to remember to be dignified
for a whole day. I tried to crush Hypo by
quoting it.
</p>

<p>
“Just so,” he said. “Dignity is the privilege
of the weak.”
</p>

<p>
She tried to imagine Miss Holland undignified.
Rushing about and babbling inconsequently.
Tiresome, men called those women,
but were glad of them if they had kind hearts.
Mrs. Orly has no dignity. But she is neither
weak nor tiresome. Her heart is a ... er ...
domesticated tornado.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-2-3">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Walking home, estranged from Miss Holland,
Miriam found her own life, that had stood all
day far away and forgotten, all about her again;
declaring itself independent of the success or
the failure of this new relationship. Like a
husband’s life ... the life he goes off into in
the morning and can lose himself in, no matter
what may be going on at home. If this new
<a id="page-70" class="pagenum" title="70"></a>
arrangement were a success, something would
be added to life. If it were a failure nothing
would be taken away.
</p>

<p>
By the time they reached home she felt free
from all interest in Miss Holland and saw their
contract as it had at first appeared, a marriage
of convenience; a bringing down of expenses
that would allow them both to live more comfortably
than they could alone. Miss Holland
no doubt saw it in the same light. The
extremest differences of outlook were neither
here nor there. There would be no need, now
that these first disordered hours were over, for
any association beyond what was needed for
the running of their quarters.
</p>

<p>
She looked forward to getting to bed in the
new surroundings, recapturing singleness and
the usual Saturday night’s sense of the spaces
of Sunday opening ahead. Fatigue had given
way to the new lease of strength that always
came if she stayed up long enough, and when
she found herself safely behind the curtain,
she hoped that Miss Holland, audible on the
other side, was sharing her sense of refreshment.
<a id="page-71" class="pagenum" title="71"></a>
She began to regret the incident that had
reduced their exchange to courteous formalities,
and to wish for an impossible re-establishment
of the inexperience of the earlier part of
the day.
</p>

<p>
Only impossible because of the way people
were influenced by things said and done. She
was herself, she knew, but never quite permanently:
never believing that what people
thought themselves to be and thought other
people to be, went quite through.... Always
certain that underneath was something else,
the same in everybody.
</p>

<p>
“Of course, I could never feel the same
again.” She could never make up her mind
whether it was good or bad not to be able to
make that statement from the heart. Whether
it was good fortune to have access to a region
where everything was forgotten, and within
which it was impossible to believe people were
what they represented themselves to be. Yet
speaking or acting suddenly from this region
where she lived with herself was always disastrous.
And still there remained that unalterable
<a id="page-72" class="pagenum" title="72"></a>
certainty that invisibly others were exactly
what she thought them, and would suddenly
turn into the person she was seeking all the
time in everyone ... the person she knew
was there.
</p>

<p>
It seemed now, so far off were those first
bright early hours, that Miss Holland and she
had been long associated. The first freshness
had gone, or she would not now find herself
with her hand on her own life. But although
that was recovered, there was now also something
else. Something going forward even as
she moved about, slowly, delightfully hindered
by new things and the need for new movements
that made the process of going to bed a
conscious ceremonial.
</p>

<p>
On the other side of the curtain Miss Holland
was moving about in the same leisurely obstructed
way. Her things were not new; but
she was having to find her way amongst them
afresh. This must be bringing all sorts of
things into her mind. They were sharing adventure.
At the very least, there was that.
It was a great deal. From the point of view
<a id="page-73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a>
of the amazingness of life and people, it was
everything. And now the strange something
was growing clearer. Their prolonged silence
was speaking.... Of course ... “<em>C’est dans
le silence que les âmes se <a id="corr-2"></a>révèlent.</em>”
</p>

<p>
Miriam tiptoed about, breathlessly listening.
Clearly, almost audibly, the silence was knitting
up the broken fabric of their intercourse.
Thought of now, Miss Holland seemed young
and small. She had been, once. Alone with
herself, of course, she still was. And at the
centre of her consciousness there was an image
of her new friend, not as she appeared to be,
but as she really was; just as within her own
consciousness there was an image of the real
Miss Holland.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland did not know this. Only one
here and there seemed to know it. And those
one never came across, except in the street
suddenly, walking by themselves. But Miss
Holland was feeling the result of the silence.
The result of their having been, <em><a id="corr-3"></a>à force de préoccupations</em>,
alone in company. Maeterlinck
would call them <em>menus préoccupations</em>. But a
<a id="page-74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a>
person standing lighting candles and moving
about a room is ... what?
</p>

<p>
A puff of wind touched the large window,
rattling it gently in its frame. Miss Holland
muttered to herself.
</p>

<p>
“I fear that window rattles,” she said at
the next sound, but still to herself, a meditative
tone.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said Miriam in cheerful conversational
voice, and at once felt its irrelevance.
She had answered only the tone. In the actual
communication there was a fresh source of
division. She loved rattling windows; loved,
loved them. Anything the wind could do,
especially at night. The window was old. It
would certainly rattle: perhaps bump and
bang. It would be better even than the small
squeak, squeak, of the small lattice at Tansley
Street. And with each sound she would be
aware of Miss Holland, disliking it.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t <em>abide</em> rattling windows,” said Miss
Holland, vindictively.
</p>

<p>
“I love them.”
</p>

<p>
“What a strange taste,” said Miss Holland
<a id="page-75" class="pagenum" title="75"></a>
ruefully, and immediately laughed her tinkling
laugh. They laughed together, and began
moving more briskly, creating a cheerful noise
to emphasise small jests. Again and again
Miss Holland’s laugh sounded. She was happy
and pleased. How embarrassing it would have
been, Miriam reflected, if the last stage of the
toilet had presented itself without this cover
of bright sound. The trial once happily over,
was over for good.
</p>

<p>
She sat on her pillow and slid down carefully
into the freshness of the new bed. Its compactness
was not disturbed. Her things were
all out of sight. The room about her was
exactly as it had been when freshly arranged.
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” she cried, listening to the pleasant
bumping of the window as her body relaxed
on the unyielding level of the new mattress
and the low pillow fitted itself to her neck. <a id="corr-4"></a>“Oh,
<a id="corr-5"></a>music that softlier on the spirit lies——”
</p>

<p>
“I hope you are not alluding to the window,”
chuckled Miss Holland.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, my bed, my angelic little bed. I
thought it might seem narrow, but it is so
<a id="page-76" class="pagenum" title="76"></a>
hard and flat that I feel as if I were lying on
the plane of the ecliptic with no sides. And
I seem so long. I can see myself like someone
laid out.”
</p>

<p>
“What a very dismal idea!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no. I always think of it when I sleep
in beds that don’t let you down. It doesn’t
depress me a bit. You see, I have no imagination.
But my bed at Tansley Street was all
hummocks. There was only one way I could
lie at all and I made no shape. Now I feel
like a crusader on a tomb, and utterly comfortable.
And the little light coming through
the curtain from your side makes a quite perfect
effect, a green twilight.”
</p>

<p>
“You shall enjoy the perfect effect for a few
moments longer. I am going to wedge that
abominable window.”
</p>

<p>
Something almost like fear took possession
of Miriam. Protest was impossible. It was
clear Miss Holland must not be tormented.
Her mind clung to the wind sounds, whilst
with small exasperated mutterings Miss Holland
sought about for something to fit the gap. An
<a id="page-77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a>
immense discomfort settled upon her when the
window was finally dumb. Its silence seemed
to press upon the air. And though the window
was open at the top, the room seemed close.
It was as if Miss Holland had robbed her of a
companion and as if far away the companion
were reproaching her for yielding without
protest to the world that keeps a suspicious
eye on the doings of the weather, an attitude
she hated like an infection. The room seemed
now full of Miss Holland; rebuked by her
into a dead stillness. That would be there on
all the nights. Each one, dumb and dead.
The prospect was unnerving. There was something
of the atmosphere of the sick-room in
this awful calm. Miss Holland’s candle was
the nightlight, keeping going the hot pressure
of the evening. Yet most people probably disliked
a rattling window, the sound that made
a stillness in the room and in the street. It
was bad to be so different and to like being
different.
</p>

<p>
How difficult to sleep in this consciously
quiet enclosure. For it was not the quiet of a
<a id="page-78" class="pagenum" title="78"></a>
still night, the kind of night in which you
listen to the expanse of space. It was a stillness
filled with the coiling emanation of a humanity
recognising only itself, intent only on its own
circlings. The darkness when it presently
came would be thick with the remainder of
the continuous coiling and fret of all those
people who live perpetually at war with everything
that is not perfectly secure.

<p class="noindent">
Miss Holland’s light was out. She was
apparently sitting up in bed arranging draperies
at great length.
</p>

<p>
“I have not locked the door,” she said, suddenly:
Miriam despaired.
</p>

<p>
“I think for to-night it does not matter.
We can make a point of remembering it in
future.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m afraid,” said Miriam, “I should <em>never</em>
remember it.”
</p>

<p>
“Have you not been in the habit of locking
your door?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-79" class="pagenum" title="79"></a>
“I never even thought of it.”
</p>

<p>
“Strange,” said Miss Holland. And Miriam
began to suppose that it was strange. She ran
over in her mind some of the odd people from
time to time sharing her lonely top floor.
Foreign waiters when Mrs. Bailey was doing
well, or queer odd men who could not afford
the downstairs rooms. She had never, at night,
given them a single thought. But that was not
the sort of thought Miss Holland meant, or
not consciously. But all this was perfectly
horrible.... Yet was it foolish, or perhaps
unkind, never to have been aware? O’Laughlin,
dear O’Laughlin. She had been aware of
him. Sorry.
</p>

<p>
“There was,” she said, “a drunken Irish
journalist who used to come blundering up
the stairs at all hours of the night.”
</p>

<p>
“Horrible, horrible,” breathed Miss Holland.
</p>

<p>
“His door,” it occurred to her for the first
time, “was at right angles to mine.” Miss
Holland was gasping. “He used to stumble
about on the landing, and sometimes, poor
dear, be sick.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a>
“Dear, dear, dear! It was a most extraordinary
establishment. But I think the
oddest thing is that you should not have made
fast the door.”
</p>

<p>
“I suppose so. But I would trust Tommy
O’Laughlin drunk or sober, now I come to
think of it.... He never paid his bills, poor
dear, and he borrowed.”
</p>

<p>
“He must have been a worthless creature.”
</p>

<p>
“He was a gentleman, Tommy was, and a
dear. Though he once embarrassed me frightfully.
It was at dinner. Of course he was
intoxicated, though not looking so. In the
midst of a long tirade about Home Rule he
burst into tears and said if he had only seen
Miss Henderson earlier in his life he would
have been a different fellow.”
</p>

<p>
“No doubt he admired you immensely!”
</p>

<p>
“I’d never spoken to him.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland laughed wisely, but a little
scornfully. No châtelaine, of course, would
boast of scalps.
</p>

<p>
“He was married!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-81" class="pagenum" title="81"></a>
“Dear, dear!” breathed Miss Holland.
</p>

<p>
“Trying for a divorce.”
</p>

<p>
“Dear, dear, <em>dear</em>!”
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-2-5">

<p class="noindent">
Miriam awoke in the darkness abruptly.
About her were the images that had filled her
mind when Miss Holland’s candle had gone
out. She regarded them sleepily, wondering
what could so soon have called her back.
What was calling her now, urgently, out from
the thickness of sleep. She stirred and woke
completely.
</p>

<p>
“Are you awake?” Miss Holland’s voice
coming anxious and reproachful through the
stillness was added to the minute unmistakable
irritations.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, are you? I mean are you being
devoured alive?”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, indeed, I <em>am</em>,” wailed Miss
Holland. “It is a <em>disaster</em>.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s weird,” said Miriam, lunging. “Where
can they all come from? I’m going to get up.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-82" class="pagenum" title="82"></a>
“Indeed, that is all we can do. Light
candles and make instant warfare.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m so sleepy. I think I shall change in
the dark.”
</p>

<p>
“I fear that will be useless,” groaned Miss
Holland, striking a match. “I fear, I fear the
worst.”
</p>

<p>
Out on the green floor and with the two
candles cheerfully gleaming.... Alone such
an adventure would have been misery.
</p>

<p>
She grew interested in following Miss
Holland’s instructions, and was almost disappointed
when the white expanse of her bed
offered no further prey.
</p>

<p>
“Seven,” she announced.
</p>

<p>
“All drowned?” asked Miss Holland suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
“Mm, poor things.”
</p>

<p>
“I fear I do not share your solicitude,”
chuckled Miss Holland.
</p>

<p>
“Well, perhaps I associate them with
summer. In a London summer there are
always one or two, having their little day. I’ve
tried once or twice to keep still and endure.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-83" class="pagenum" title="83"></a>
“And then?”
</p>

<p>
“I shake my nightgown out of the window,
but always feel mean.”
</p>

<p>
“You are <em>most</em> tender-hearted.”
</p>

<p>
“I agree with the Frenchman, ‘<em>ce n’est
point la piqûre dont je me plains, c’est le promenade.</em>’”
</p>

<p>
“You speak French delightfully, toote ah
fay kom oon Parisienne.”
</p>

<p>
“Imitation; I can imitate any sound. But
where do all these fleas <em>come</em> from?”
</p>

<p>
“The floor, the floor, I fear.”
</p>

<p>
“Heaven and earth! We must leave at
once.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I think perhaps with perchloride in
the cracks ...”
</p>

<p>
“Meantime?”
</p>

<p>
“We must do our best.”
</p>

<p>
“It goes from the brain to the toes.”
</p>

<p>
“To the <em>toes</em>. But only for the unfortunate
possessors of thin skins. And them, the
wretches seek. If there were in the universe
only one flea, it would make straight for
me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a>
Her voice ended on a childish wail. <em>Fleee</em>,
she had said, making it innocent and pretty.
</p>

<p>
“Do you mean to say there are people ...”
</p>

<p>
“I do indeed. During my first period of
training in the slums I was amazed at the
complete insensibility of many of my fellow-workers.
Amazed, and under the circumstances,
envious.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, I don’t envy them a bit. Those people
with skins like felt; they miss everything.”
</p>

<p>
“I agree. At the same time, I think a
moderately thick skin is a boon. I see no disadvantage
in escaping intolerable discomforts.
It is possible to have too thin a skin.”
</p>

<p>
“For survival, yes. Blond people are dying
out, they say.”
</p>

<p>
“Blondes have not a monopoly of thin
skins.”
</p>

<p>
“No. I have a friend who slums. She
loathes the poor.”
</p>

<p>
“Dear, dear; a most unfortunate qualification
for her work.”
</p>

<p>
“Not their poverty. Their sameness. She
is one of the kindest people I know.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a>
“Strange....”
</p>

<p>
“They ought to be pensioned.”
</p>

<p>
“The poor?”
</p>

<p>
“Everybody. I should love to be pensioned.”
</p>

<p>
“And remain in idleness and dependence?
Oh, no.”
</p>

<p>
“Not dependence. Interdependence. No
compulsion.”
</p>

<p>
“What would you do?”
</p>

<p>
“Spend several years staring; and then go
round the world.”
</p>

<p>
“You are delightful! I am not sure that I
approve of the years of staring. But to go
round the world would, of course, be most
enchanting.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes: but I should not want to improve
my mind. I should still stare. If I went.
Probably I shouldn’t go. Nothing short of
dynamite will shift me. I am astounded to
find myself shifted here.”
</p>

<p>
“I fear at the moment you must be wishing
yourself safely back again.”
</p>

<p>
She had no realisation of the adventure it
was to be anywhere at all. To her it was not
<a id="page-86" class="pagenum" title="86"></a>
a strange, strange adventure that their two
voices should be sounding together in the
night, a double thread of sound in a private
darkness, making a pattern with all the other
sounds in the world. But she had accepted the
compliment. There was a vibration in her
voice: joyful.
</p>

<p>
Again and again they were awakened for
battle, until their slumber was too deep to be
disturbed.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-2-6">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
St. Pancras bells were cheerfully thumping
the air when Miriam got up to wander about
in the dark brilliance that filled the room like
the presence of a guest, and was so exaggerated
that it not only supplied a topic wherewith to
start the morning, but an occupation engrossing
enough to free her, even in thought, from
descent into the detail of the day. It held
everything off and yet kept her in happy communion
with Miss Holland moving busily the
other side of the curtain.
</p>

<p>
Yet the night had done its work. A host of
<a id="page-87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>
statements were plucking at her mind: balancing
the quality of life here and life at Tansley
Street. At week-ends. Behind them was a
would-be disquieting assertion of the now
complete remoteness of both her working life
and the eventful leisure that had for so long
ousted the old-time Tansley Street evenings.
It was a bill of costs, flourished; demanding
to know what she had done.
</p>

<p>
But it stood off, powerless to gain the centre
of her attention, making no break in her sense
of being nowhere; of inhabiting, within a
shadowless brilliance, a living peace that held her
immensely unoccupied, and ready, whenever
things should once more present themselves in
detail, to see them all in a fresh light.
</p>

<p>
For a while it seemed that they could never
again so present themselves. The light as she
gazed into it was endless, multiplying upon
itself; drawing her away from all known
things. Life henceforth would more fully
attain her, lived as at this moment she knew
it could be lived, uncalculating from the deeps
of a masked splendour.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-88" class="pagenum" title="88"></a>
It would not last. Already the strange
moments were linking themselves with kindred
strange moments in the past. But like them
it set itself while it lasted over against the
rest of her experience, with a challenge.
</p>

<p>
It was growing steadily darker.
</p>

<p>
“It’s a thunderstorm.”
</p>

<p>
“I think so. The air is most oppressive.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland came and stood at her own half
of the window so that they were side by side
and visible to each other. Above the curtain
screening the lower part of their window, they
looked across to the white pillar of candle. A
flash of bright daylight lit up the grey street,
and soon the wheels of the storm rumbled
high up across the sky. Heavy drops fell
slowly, increasing until they came in a
torrent.
</p>

<p>
“That will carry it off.”
</p>

<p>
“Sometimes I don’t mind storms. I don’t
to-day.”
</p>

<p>
They held their places at the window,
watching the pale lightning light the rain,
hearing the thunder follow more swiftly.
<a id="page-89" class="pagenum" title="89"></a>
Presently a blinding white fire and a splintering
crash just above their heads made them both
exclaim.
</p>

<p>
As the thunder rolled bumping and
snarling away across the sky they saw the figure
of a man appear from the darkness beyond the
candle and stand pressed close to the window
with arms upstretched and laid against the
panes. Through the sheets of rain his face was
not quite clear. But he was dark and pale and
tall and shouting at the storm. So he lived
there alone. The storm was a companion. He
was alone and aware. Had he seen the new
people across the way?
</p>

<p>
A brilliant flash lit up the white face and its
frame of heavy hair. The dark eyes were looking
straight across.
</p>

<p>
<em>Sayce</em>: and he lived <em>here</em>. Miriam drew
back and sat down on the end of her bed.
This queer alley was then the place in all
London in which to live. He had found it
for himself. Was he dismayed at the sight of
philistines invading the retreat where he lived
hidden amongst unseeing villagers? She vowed
<a id="page-90" class="pagenum" title="90"></a>
not again to look across when there was any
sign of his presence. He should be invaded
without knowing it. She would see him go in
and out, see without seeing: screening him
even from her own observation. And all the
time his presence would cast its light upon
their frontage.
</p>

<p>
“The strange room,” said Miss Holland,
who also had left the window, “has a tenant
as eccentric as itself.”
</p>

<p>
“Do you know who it <em>is</em>?” Miriam stole
back to the window to learn the disposition of
the door of his house. He had disappeared.
It was a side door, next to the cobbler’s window,
like theirs next to the stonemason’s.
</p>

<p>
“It is Sayce. E. W. Sayce ... the
poet.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed?” exclaimed Miss Holland delightedly.
“A poet. That is charming. Quite
enchanting to feel that poetry is being written
so near at hand.”
</p>

<p>
She was peering out, as if looking for verses
on the air between the opposing windows.
She had no feeling of shyness in mentioning
<a id="page-91" class="pagenum" title="91"></a>
his work. If unobserved she could catch him
at it, she would note his methods. Perhaps he
would sit there at work in his window. But
the least they could do, having innocently
become witnesses of his workshop, would be to
stand off and leave him free.
</p>

<p>
To disperse Miss Holland’s concentration,
she rushed into speech.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve known him by sight for years, wandering
about in a black cloak. One night I was
strolling along the strip of pavement round
one of the Square gardens. It was quite dark
under the trees between the stretches of lamplight,
and there was nobody about. Suddenly
in a patch of light I was confronted by a tall
figure, also strolling. We both stood quite
still, staring into each other’s eyes with thoughts
far away, each taking in only the fact of an
obstruction. Then I realised it was Sayce. I
can’t remember how we got past each other.
One of us must presently have plunged into
the gutter. But, looking back, it seems as if
we walked through each other.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland produced a series of bird-like
<a id="page-92" class="pagenum" title="92"></a>
sounds, each seeming in turn to refuse to make
a word.
</p>

<p>
The storm was moving on and the strange
light, lifting as the sky cleared, left a blankness.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-2-7">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Later in the morning the light from a clear
high sky broke up the harmony between the
things in the room and set a pallor upon the
green pathway to the window. It was the
end of a story, the story of the first morning—a
single prolonged moment that would last.
</p>

<p>
It was over, and here she was, conscious of
her surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Something must be swiftly woven up with
the treasure she held in her hands or she would
drop into the crude spaces of this midday light
and lose the threads. She heard Miss Holland,
as if in response to her need, leave the little
back room and go upstairs. It would be in
order, the little back room. A room apart,
like Mag’s and Jan’s old sitting-room in
Kenneth Street that used to seem such a
<a id="page-93" class="pagenum" title="93"></a>
triumph of elaborate living. Her spirit went
forth and nested incredulously within the little
back room.
</p>

<p>
“It will mean growing plump and sedentary.
Not wanting to sail forth and see people.
Wanting people to come to me, hear the tinkle
of my tea-things, sink into the world a bright
little afternoon-tea scene makes on Sundays
for people who have no centre.”
</p>

<p>
By Jove, yes. One of the reasons why
household people like the odd, homeless sort
is that they make them realise the snugness by
revelling in it.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland was audible upstairs rattling
saucepan lids. They were to feed up there,
kept warm by the ugly oil-cooker, and reserve
the back room for elegant life and tea-parties.
</p>

<p>
Already Miss Holland had made breakfast
on the cooker. By means of some mechanism
in its interior. Interesting to explore. One
day she would explore it. Find out its secret
and then to be quite sure, ask Miss Holland. It
stood out, as she thought of it, as the most
fascinating thing upstairs, next to the way the
<a id="page-94" class="pagenum" title="94"></a>
light came through the long lattice; and the
shadows upon the slopes of the roof.
</p>

<p>
“You shall teach me,” she heard her own
sleepy voice over the welcome tray; “how to
kick——”
</p>

<p>
“How to kick a cooper!” Miss Holland had
trilled without a moment’s hesitation, and,
after they had laughed: “Kippers require
<em>very</em> little in the way of cooking.” A memory
of Eleanor: “’Addocks don’t ’ardly <em>need</em> any
cooking de-er.”
</p>

<p>
She tipped herself off the little bed that
made such an excellent sofa, and strolled into
the back room.
</p>

<p>
It was darker than ever. Round and round
she looked, taking in the things. Looking for
more, and different, things. Absurdly half
believing that the things she saw would change,
would somehow become different under her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Green serge curtains, patched and faded,
hung dismally on either side of the window.
Two easy-chairs covered with faded threadbare
cretonne filled, with their huge ugliness, the
<a id="page-95" class="pagenum" title="95"></a>
main part of the floor-space. Between them
stood a stained and battered bamboo table and
an ancient footstool, worn colourless. Pushed
into a corner was a treadle sewing-machine,
and at its side a small round table bearing a
tarnished lamp. That was all. That was all
there would be in their sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
The worst was that nothing shone. Nothing
reflected light. It suddenly struck her
as an odd truth that nothing of Miss
Holland’s reflected light. Even the domed
wooden cover of the sewing-machine, which
was polished and should have shone, was filmed
and dull.
</p>

<p>
The only suggestion of life in the room
would be the backs of the books stacked in
piles on the mantelshelf. She found relief
for her oppression in the minute gilded titles
of some of the books. They gleamed faintly
in the gloom, minute threads of gold.
</p>

<p>
Well, here it was, the lovely little sitting-room....
</p>

<p>
She moved about in it, still unable quite to
exorcise the idea that it would change. With
<a id="page-96" class="pagenum" title="96"></a>
eyes cast down, she made her way from part
to part, imagined varnish on the floor. Flowers
set about. People, hiding the chairs. It
would be pain to bring friends in. Cruelty to
ask anyone to endure the room for an hour.
</p>

<p>
There would be no tea-parties.
</p>

<p>
When her attention returned, Miss Holland’s
dead belongings had changed a little. They
were forgotten and familiar. Here, after all,
was a room and a window, and the things were
sufficient. Unobtrusive, like dowdy clothes.
She remembered how, between-whiles, she
loved dowdiness. How her heart went forth
with mysterious desire to thoroughly dowdy,
flat-haired women. Women who had no style
but their set of beliefs.
</p>

<p>
Something of this kind must have drawn
her to Miss Holland, even while she saw her
only as a possible sharer of expenses....
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland had been brought by her star.
She was moving about on the upstair landing
in her heavy, light-footed way, busy and intent.
She coughed. Her cough had exactly
the sound of her voice.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-97" class="pagenum" title="97"></a>
Would it be possible to go through life in
the state of permanent protest expressed by
that eloquent cough? For a day perhaps.
But a night’s sleep <a id="corr-7"></a>plays strange tricks.
</p>

<p>
Yet the shock of the furniture had confirmed
her sense that something was being
offered. Low-toned, apparently gloomy, yet
having a strange fascination, a <em>quality</em>. If she
put forth no resistance it might be the most
exciting, revealing, adventure she had yet had.
It was an offer; an offer of the chance of
becoming a postulant châtelaine.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-2-8">

<p class="noindent">
“But you make tea with a <em>charm</em>! This is
Nectar!”
</p>

<p>
Miriam stood with the teapot in her hand,
looking forward to everlasting Sundays of
making tea for Miss Holland and charming
her with conversation. They had talked all
the afternoon without weariness. The day
stretched back long and eventful, full of talk
and laughter, to the far-off episode of the
<a id="page-98" class="pagenum" title="98"></a>
morning. Filled with memories, the rooms
had grown dear. And the evening lay ahead,
secure, if they chose to remain shut up here
together. Then a week apart. No evenings.
Miss Holland coming home late and tired.
There would be only the week-ends for the
continuation of their talk.
</p>

<p>
“The fiancée came to tea yesterday,” she
said, unawares and stopped. Miss Holland,
surely, must be weary of her stories. “I must
stop,” she said, “finish my tea and absolutely,
really unpack.”
</p>

<p>
“By no means, mademoiselle, having uttered
the fascinating word, you must continue.”
</p>

<p>
Forcing back a smile, Miriam went on with
her story. Marvelling at a world that had left
this woman to loneliness. Lonely as she was,
she scanned life unenviously, placed herself at
once sympathetically within the experience of
anyone presented to her. It was as if she herself
had had vast experience. Yet in her life
there were only those two parts; the vicarage
home until she was thirty-five and then the
life in London. She had brought with her all
<a id="page-99" class="pagenum" title="99"></a>
the old-fashioned ideas, and yet, without being
a socialist, had a forward-going mind, a surer
certainty of social transformation than was to
be found amongst the Lycurgans.
</p>

<p>
“I told her I hoped she knew she was
marrying the best man in the world.”
</p>

<p>
“Delightful. You made her very happy.”
</p>

<p>
“Although extremely strong-minded and in
the midst of a successful career, she is a girl,
the English girl in the midst of the divine
illusion.”
</p>

<p>
“Why Divine <em>illusion</em>? So contradictory.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, illusion because its picture of what
life with the beloved will be is mistaken.
Divine because it reveals to both the best in
themselves and each other, what they really
<em>are</em>, without knowing it until then.”
</p>

<p>
“Y ... es,” said Miss Holland, clasping
the edge of the table and gazing out through
the window. “It is unfortunate that it is so
frequently doomed to die and inevitably to
change.”
</p>

<p>
“Never. In women, absolutely never, once
it’s there.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-100" class="pagenum" title="100"></a>
“Ah, in <em>women</em>.”
</p>

<p>
“She’s an amazing person. Can fall out of
a moving cab without being hurt. She said,
of course, that she knew. But wanted to hear
all about him.”
</p>

<p>
“You were able to render her a charming
service.”
</p>

<p>
“No. It frightened me for her sake that
she wanted to talk about him. Of course, she
thought me tongue-tied. I was. But only
because feeling that her best realisation was
just that moment with me. If we had talked,
there would have been a wilderness of detail,
and the moment gone without taking its full
effect.”
</p>

<p>
“Yet it is most natural that she should have
wished to talk of him.”
</p>

<p>
“It frightened me. She had a charming
white hat.”
</p>

<p>
Though she went on for a while humouring
Miss Holland’s desire for pictures and stories,
she now framed her discourse in ready-made
phrases, and was interested in seeing the way
they made effects such as she herself had often
<a id="page-101" class="pagenum" title="101"></a>
gathered up from heard conversations, and in
discovering how they fitted a shape of thought
about life and led on automatically to other
phrases, little touches that finished them off;
till she began to believe that life was expressible
in these forms of thought which yet she
knew left everything untouched.
</p>

<p>
But the centre of her interest, the thing
that was making her talk grow absent and
careless, and consist more and more of sounds
in response to Miss Holland’s lingering consideration
of all that had pleased her, was the
way that unawares during their long sitting
the room had come to life. Nothing now
looked dingy. There was a warm brightness;
within the air.
</p>

<p>
When their talk had drifted to a pause and
she was alone, she ruefully regarded the day’s
interchange. Shadowless only by being an
excursion into a world she had long ago ceased
to inhabit. By using only materials that would
make common ground, she had woven a fabric
of false impressions.
</p>

<p>
Again and again as they talked the set of
<a id="page-102" class="pagenum" title="102"></a>
circumstances that were the zest of her personal
life had risen before her, in terms such
as Miss Holland would use in describing them,
and made a preoccupation that had kept her
a bright and interesting talker. Yet Miss
Holland was aware. Though in her eagerness
for every word she had shown only awareness
of a different reach and different perceptions,
she knew, without recognising its nature, that
between them there was a gulf.
</p>

<p>
To keep back even half-accepted points of
view was not fair play. Brought uneasiness.
Yet why tell her of things that might not
happen?

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">erenity</span> had retreated outdoors, and
increased there. To-day, in the space
between the week’s work and the week-end
with its pattern ready-set, was serenity immeasurable;
given by autumn. Autumn
gleaming beyond the park railings through
sunlit mist.
</p>

<p>
Autumn had accumulated unawares. But
this meeting with it had begun early this
morning in the balmy stillness of the square.
Just when the lame old woman had crossed
the street. Cheerfully; unhampered by heat
or cold or wind.
</p>

<p>
It had made the happiness of the morning’s
work, its gaiety and ease. And now at its
midday fulness it made the visit of the Brooms—so
central as she had sat at her ledgers—retreat
into the background. This still air
<a id="page-104" class="pagenum" title="104"></a>
passing into her spirit, the great trees standing
in it, thick with coloured leaves upon the
spread of misty grass, stamping their image,
would remain when the rest of the holiday
was forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Yet the Brooms, both Grace and Florrie,
belonged to the unfathomable depth of autumn.
Not to its wholeness. To single features. Any
single feature contemplated brought them
there to look and love. Only in London.
They belonged to London from the first.
To the heavy, tinted trees. To the first
breath of exciting, on-coming cold, distilling
the radiance of the sun-warmed earth. To the
mauve twilights of fogless November days.
To Christmas, and to June with spring and
summer together in the scent of sweet briar
wafted across their suburban garden; making,
in its small green space with masonry visible
all about, a sharper sense of summer than was
to be found in the open country. They
belonged to every feature of the London
weather. Taking the sting from the worst
and adding brightness to the best.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-105" class="pagenum" title="105"></a>
But this opening with its view of the short
broad path belongs to no one. The sight of
it is always a stepping forward into nowhere
with eyes on the low fence at the end, the
gap, the two poplars pluming up on either
side, making it a stately portal to the green
expanses beyond.
</p>

<p>
The poplars say:
</p>

<div class="poem-container">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Les yeux gris</p>
      <p class="verse">Vont au paradis.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
And the picture remains after the high railings
have come back again. Its message brings
more light than there is into the thickets of
shrubs and bushes, and takes the suggestion of
sadness from the stretches of grass dulled even
in sunlight by the thick autumn air.
</p>

<p>
<em>Les yeux gris</em>; in spring and autumn.
</p>

<p>
But most clearly in autumn when the air
of the park is rich with outbreathed summer.
Answering everything with the unanswerable
beauty of autumn.

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The afternoon streets were bustling with
farewells to the week. Out across them went
her own glances of farewell, making them
newly dear and keeping them still echoing
about her when she arrived to be alone by
daylight for the first time in the ancient
stillness of the house.
</p>

<p>
She hurried upstairs to take possession and
prepare for the coming of the Brooms.
</p>

<p>
The stillness was absolute. New in her experience
and disquieting. Her old room had
always greeted her. Had been full at once
with the sound and colour of her life.
</p>

<p>
This stillness was impermeable. Wrapped
within it the rooms disowned her. Maliciously,
now that they had her to themselves, they
announced the fact behind the charms of the
week of settling in. Bereavement. Not only
of her self, left behind irrevocably in the old
room, but also now that she surveyed it undisturbed
by Miss Holland’s supporting presence,
of the bright motley of her outside life.
<a id="page-107" class="pagenum" title="107"></a>
Everything had thinned, was going thinly
forward without depth of background. Against
these ancient rooms she was powerless.
</p>

<p>
If she were living alone in them? She
imagined herself living alone in them, and at
once the tide of her life began to rise and flow
out and change them. They dropped their
ancient preoccupations and turned friendly
faces towards her, promising welfare.
</p>

<p>
But as long as she stayed in them accompanied
they would acquire no depth. Their
depth was the level of her relationship to Miss
Holland. Without her she was lost in them,
a moving form whose sounds impinged less
surely upon their stillness than the sounds of
the mice scampering over the attic floor.
</p>

<p>
All through the week in coming home late
each evening to the certainty of talk, to hurried
sleep in the orderliness created by Miss Holland,
there had been a glad sense of life renewed.
New, exciting life, bringing at first the surprise
of an escape homeward that had left the
London years unreal; a tale told busily day
by day to drown the voices calling her home.
<a id="page-108" class="pagenum" title="108"></a>
That first sense of home-coming had vanished,
lost among the entertainments of unfamiliar
ways of living. But it had been at work all
the week. All the week, serving as space for
continuous talk, the rooms had been changing,
growing larger, expanding together with the
life lived there, a wealth falling into her hands
too swiftly for counting.
</p>

<p>
Apart from that life they were nothing.
They stood defined, mean and dismal, crushing
her. And for these mean and dismal
rooms, set above a thick ascending darkness
where other lives were hemmed and crushed,
she had sacrificed the spacious house with its
unexplored distances and its perpetual familiar
strangeness.
</p>

<p>
And haunting each room, as in solitude she
surveyed it, was the mocking image of Sheffield.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-3">
3
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
And at this moment Miss Holland, in half-holiday
mood, would be buoyantly pacing
some chosen part of the glad open wilderness
<a id="page-109" class="pagenum" title="109"></a>
of London. Well had she known what she
escaped in refusing to deal with Sheffield.
But she did not know that life set to weekly
meetings with him was darkened not only
because he was “odious,” but also because
the paying of rent tore life up by the roots.
</p>

<p>
The payment of Mrs. Bailey’s bills, looked
back to now, seemed to be all a single transaction:
a chance meeting on the stairs, a hurried
handing of money, eye to eye, smiling. A
single guilty moment and then a resumption
of a relationship not based on money. It
had marked, not the passage of time, but its
rest, at an unchanging centre. Paying rent to
this man would be counting off time; and a
weekly reminder of the payment for life going
on all over the world. To be obliged at the
best moment of each week to face Sheffield,
acknowledging another week passed in the
world as he saw it, would be to fight without
weapons against the mocking reflection in the
mirror he held up.
</p>

<p>
Putting off the ordeal until the last moment,
she prepared for the coming of the Brooms.
<a id="page-110" class="pagenum" title="110"></a>
Reflected in the long mirror was her gay carefree
self, the self that bore in the eyes watching
it from their distant suburb, a charmed
life; offering no resting-place for the pity
they wanted to bestow. It would remain when
they had gone, and would carry off the rent-paying
with a high hand.
</p>

<p>
They were coming. Soon their voices would
sound about her in the different rooms.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-4">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
It was her happiness that had hailed them
from afar and summoned them without a
thought of how these new quarters would
appear in their eyes. In the eyes of Mrs.
Philps, dressed for an afternoon call and now
already on her way....
</p>

<p>
Unless she said Miss Holland was at
home and ill and at once took them to the
club, they would come up, through the smells
and gloom of the passage and stairway, expecting
at least a bright, flowered-chintz flat....
</p>

<p>
The ordeal of facing Sheffield had now
<a id="page-111" class="pagenum" title="111"></a>
turned into a reprieve. She ran downstairs
and knocked peremptorily at his door, which
opened immediately upon him shirt-sleeved,
his sparse hair in wisps about a preoccupied
face. His private face, caught unawares, reflecting
thoughts turned upon detail. After
all, he had a personal life, perplexities. There
was nothing in the poor thing to dread. It
was idiotic to hold him in mind as waiting
there behind the door for her coming.
</p>

<p>
His eager, inattentive voice, bidding her
upstairs, sounded about her as she stated her
errand. She went up the uncarpeted stairs to
set the rapid tapping of her shoes against the
influences brooding in the ancient gloom.
</p>

<p>
“My <em>mother</em> is upstairs,” he said from
behind, in his mocking sing-song. Hearing it
again, Miriam thought of it as a silence, with
mocking speech extending before and after;
the uniform sound of his mind. A good mind,
ill-fed and circling. Recognisable English
prejudices, soured.
</p>

<p>
“<em>This</em> is Miss Henderson,” he cried gleefully
closing the door behind her, the door of
<a id="page-112" class="pagenum" title="112"></a>
a room already, with its coffee-coloured lace
curtains keeping out the shadowed light of
the court, in a heavy twilight. The same voice,
feebler, but deeper and flexibly rumbling,
came from a mass risen up at the fireside, a
mass of draperies about a tall form unsteadily
bowing and capped with ponderous lace.
</p>

<p>
The voice rumbled on while Sheffield put a
chair for her, and it seemed at the end of a
few minutes that she had been sitting there
indefinitely, listening to a flow of speech that
communicated nothing but its tone. Yet she
had spoken. She remembered the sound of her
own voice in the room, the voice of all her
family. And there was the semblance of conversation,
Sheffield standing by, chanting refrains,
presiding. Triumphantly, as if he had
purposely brought her to face and be overwhelmed
by their united voices.
</p>

<p>
She braced herself to resist the influence of
this life-stuff seething bitterly in its corner.
But it cast shadow everywhere. Sitting
smiling and inattentive, she heard the continuation
backwards through the years, through
<a id="page-113" class="pagenum" title="113"></a>
all the years she had known and further back
into those differently lovely years her parents
had known, of these bitter life-shadowing
voices. They went forward too, shadowing
the future, until death should silence them.
</p>

<p>
Opposition would be futile. Her words
would fly like chaff before the wind of their
large bitterness, a general arraignment, she
gathered, growing used to the angry sing-song,
of everything in the world.
</p>

<p>
She thought of the autumn sunlight, held
it in her mind, thought of it as existing in their
minds and in the minds of everyone in London
to-day; the hint of an answer, the moment
one paused to look at it, to every problem in
the world. But these two were not perceiving
the sunlight in her mind. Aware of her submissive
attention, they were growing more
explicit, going into detail, one against the other,
cantori and decani. Mother and son, bitterness
embodied, thought out, added to, grown
old behind a close hedge of contempt for
everything <em>new</em>.
</p>

<p>
They had a sort of clear-sighted observation.
<a id="page-114" class="pagenum" title="114"></a>
Humanity, they would say if they had the
words, doesn’t change <em>essentially</em>. But to get
anywhere with that conviction they ought to
be religious. To be in a group. They were
cut off from the religion that goes with the
attitude. An amateur church, self-ended.
They were the offshoots of the worst kind of
Protestantism. Protestant enlightenment in
a vacuum....
</p>

<p>
Sadness grew in her with the sense of the
utter absence in herself of anything wherewith
to stem the bitter flood. The refuge she was
taking in apparent acceptance was a condemnation.
Leaving her less than they.
</p>

<p>
When at last the rent was paid and she was
free to go, such a length of life had been
passed in the sad room, so much unfamiliar
experience lived through, that the parting was
like a parting with old friends. Unawares,
she found herself voicing regret for her forced
departure and promising to come again. She
felt her future divided between the two
houses set so closely side by side. They smiled,
pleased. Stood close, flattering and fondling
<a id="page-115" class="pagenum" title="115"></a>
her with their voices. They had had a happy
hour. The old woman came to the top of the
stairs to speed her on her way. Standing on the
landing with escape at hand, she had a moment
of hesitation. Voicelessly she cancelled her
compliance, stood free and remote and felt as
she went how their scorn followed her, scorn
of anything that could not ring against their
hardness any hardness of its own.
</p>

<p>
Outside in the court, she paced to-and-fro
between her door and the entrance to the
main street, waiting in the free air of her own
world for the coming of her friends. But no
oblivion could draw out the bitterness folded
into her memory. And though the voices of
the friends would drown the sound of that
murderous chanting, the thing behind it, the
thing she had recognised in Sheffield a week
ago was something ultimate. Inexorable; a
flourishing part of the world’s life not hitherto
clearly known to her, all the time taking effect
in the sum total. Life being hated, seen only
as material for bitter laughter.
</p>

<p>
She looked up at the neat respectable house-front,
<a id="page-116" class="pagenum" title="116"></a>
the best in the court, at the shrouded
windows of the room where still her spirit
lingered. Next week she would stand firm
and pay the rent at the door. Better still, the
inspiration came together with the sound of
the Brooms’ voices behind her, slip it into the
letter-box. The Sheffields were banished.
The scene ahead held now no shadow but the
weekly call of the raucous-voiced, knocker-slamming
men from the Snow-white laundry
that had for so long impersonally fetched
and returned her things, losing nothing, and
now turning out to be linked to its delighted
clients not as she had imagined by some fresh,
kindly, middle-aged woman, but by these
grubby cigarette-smoking, impatient men with
the voices of mutinous slaves.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-5">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
It was not only Mrs. Philps who was dumb.
The girls, too, came up in pensive amazement
through the darkness and smells of the lower
floors to arrive silent on the bleak top landing.
<a id="page-117" class="pagenum" title="117"></a>
Miriam displayed the rooms, making much, as
they stood about gathering up with trained
eyes the mournful details, of the general loftiness,
the large windows, the many doors. On
the way up to the attic she remembered that
she had not shown the painted ceiling.
</p>

<p>
Since the first shock of Miss Holland’s furniture
she had forgotten the existence of the
ancient splendour brooding above. Each going
into the little room had brought the hope of
finding it changed, less gloomy, less dull and
lifeless. Until accepting, she had ceased to see
anything but the light travelling through the
square window to die. Reappearing now in her
mind, the faded ceiling restored her first vision
of the rooms. The way they had seemed
porous to the sound and sunlight of the
open.
</p>

<p>
Her visitors stood in the doorway of the
attic looking in vain for something upon which
their eyes might rest. In her half of the bedroom,
kept till the last, they would find what
they sought, feel radiating there the more
brightly for their coming, something of what
<a id="page-118" class="pagenum" title="118"></a>
it was that held her life entranced and held
them to herself. She, too, would feel it; the
incommunicable quality that crept sooner or
later into her surroundings, deep and central
within the air. It was there waiting for
everyone, within their own surroundings. But
so many seemed to ignore it, and others,
chafing, imagined it elsewhere, far off.
</p>

<p>
The girls made straight for the bureau,
admiring, repeating phrases of warm admiration
in tones whose relief voiced all their earlier
embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
“Pretty,” said Mrs. Philps, who had come
down the room to look. “Imitation Chippendale.”
</p>

<p>
Glancing round, she brought her eyes quickly
back to the bureau, at which the girls were
gazing as if afraid to look elsewhere. Joining
them near the window, to which presently all
three had turned as if in the hope of finding
material for comment outside, Miriam remembered
Sayce. Sayce would enlighten
them. The sight of his chosen dwelling-place
would bring them, nearer than anything she
<a id="page-119" class="pagenum" title="119"></a>
might try to say, a vision of her world not as
a thing pitiful compared to the world they
knew, but as something differently real.
</p>

<p>
“Across the way,” she said lightly, “in
rooms exactly matching these, is a poet, a
great poet.” She watched Mrs. Philps glance
across to the opposite house.
</p>

<p>
“He might have an <em>office</em> there perhaps,”
said Mrs. Philps with an expression Miriam had
seen on the faces of gentlewomen doing
distasteful kitchen jobs, lips held in, the
upper lip drawn slightly back showing the
teeth.
</p>

<p>
She hurried them off to the club.
</p>

<p>
Out in the street, the three were at once
acting upon her in their old way, revealing
the power built up in their sheltered lives.
How far, with their untaxed strength, they
outdid her in swiftness of observation. How
well they knew and how warmly they cherished
every stock and stone upon the highways of
London. They had due knowledge. But it
was knowledge enclosed, multiplying only upon
itself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-120" class="pagenum" title="120"></a>
Vainly as they carried her along, surrounding
her, accustomed to her silence and unresentful,
she sought for a clear centre where
these old friends and the friends with whom
her life was now involved, might meet and
understand each other. Philistia. The mental
immobility of Philistines. But Philistines
within their own world were rich and racy.
Their critics in failing to savour the essence
of middle-class life, missed the essence of all
life whatsoever. They feared the <em>power</em> of
the Philistines. Their power of stifling freedom.
Freedom for what? Freedom, unless
people became samurai, slid down into a pit.
Perhaps these clever scornful ones, the moderns
and the Lycurgans, were all escaped Philistines?
</p>

<p>
Hearing the life in their voices, she loved
them as they were, unchangeable. Through
philistinism lay perhaps one of the ways of
salvation. No. In the midst of the happiness
they brought there was always a lurking
shadow. The shadow of incompatibility; of
the impossibility of being at once bound and
free. The garden breeds a longing for the
<a id="page-121" class="pagenum" title="121"></a>
wild; the wild a homesickness for the garden.
Is there no way of life where the two can meet?
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-3-6">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
And here, she realised as they went up the
wide staircase, the broad way leading easily to
the destruction of home-made ideas, was a small
beginning of such a way of life. Within it
the Brooms were small and helpless. Travellers
in an unknown land, not yet able to take their
bearings. They would recover. Later on, at
home, they might make their severe comments,
but unawares the range of their vision would
have been enlarged. Gleefully she felt their
irrevocable experience as they stood ranged
just as they had been at the door of her sitting-room,
in the doorway of the club smoking-room
looking in upon women, unmistakable
gentlewomen, lounging insouciantly. Representing
not names and families but selves in
their own right.
</p>

<p>
The drawing-room was again crowded, and
again there was one free table near a window
<a id="page-122" class="pagenum" title="122"></a>
looking out upon the stately autumn trees and
upon it tea set ready, waiting for them as the
result of the order they had not seen her give
in the hall. It was a perfect moment. Here
they were at last after all the years, her guests
at a table of her own. And they were much
more than at home and happy. They were at
court, in the heart of splendours. The girls
admired openly. And Mrs. Philps, whose
affection for her had flourished upon a background
of pity and half-indulgent disapproval,
withdrew all their past battlings in one glance,
arch, bridling, altogether delighted and approving.
</p>

<p>
But in the perfect moment a light had gone
up that showed Miriam a new self and a new
world. It was she, not they, who was abroad
in a strange land. She who was travelling ahead
beyond recall. The decoration bestowed upon
her by Mrs. Philps was already askew, not
suiting her, not desired. The understanding
exchanged between them was of a pact she
would never willingly fulfil. The women’s
pact. And while dispensing tea, talking as
<a id="page-123" class="pagenum" title="123"></a>
they liked her to talk, making a little drama
for their delight, she privately thanked life
for turning on this light in the presence of
friends who, cherishing her smallest expressiveness,
left her free to survey this new aspect
of things whilst the light was still at its first
brilliance.
</p>

<p>
A disquieting brilliance. For her initiation
as a hostess was so slight. To sit thus, irresponsibly
dispensing club fare, was the merest
hint and shadow of hostess-ship. Yet it had
been enough to make the world anew.
</p>

<p>
To feel charming, to want to be charming,
to join for a moment the great army of hostesses
as an equal was proud experience. But
it was also a sort of death. For it included
letting everything in the world go by. Feeling
ready to do or say anything that would contribute
to the comfort and happiness of one’s
guests. In Mrs. Philps’ smile there had been,
unknown to Mrs. Philps, the recognition of
another victim joining the conspiracy of the
regiment. And she had recognised aright.
</p>

<p>
For here, complete and full-grown within
<a id="page-124" class="pagenum" title="124"></a>
herself, was one alert to avoid anything leading
to discord. Aware of convictions and points
of view, personal feelings, everything that
made one’s own intimate vision of life, shelved;
receding and falling as if shamed, into the
loneliest background of consciousness. If all
this and much more, things revealed and sliding
away too swiftly be caught and examined,
were the price of merely entertaining friends
at a club, what of the <em>real</em> hostess? What of
the millions of women serving life sentences?
Hostesses not only to friends but to households,
willing or unwilling humbugs for life.
</p>

<p>
Yet the game is enchanting. And brings
within an immense loneliness a sort of freedom.
That was there distinctly. A sort of enforced
freedom. To have nothing oneself. To seek
only the being of others, regardless of their
quality as persons; feel only their weight as
mere humanity. Humanity seen thus as guests
without distinction brought back the wonder
of life renewed. Pitiful and splendid. If
these strange large beings taking tea were
thieves and murderers, the joy of tending them
<a id="page-125" class="pagenum" title="125"></a>
would be the same. Perhaps greater. It was
more thrilling to wait upon Florrie and
Mrs. Philps, whose lives she shared only
imaginatively, than upon Grace, with whom
she had a sort of identity.

<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">waggering</span> along the middle of the
empty pavement, the long cape of his
short overcoat swinging like the cloak of a
stage villain. With bent head he is playing
his part to an imagined audience. He knows
nothing of the contrast between the small
figure and the big arrogance.
</p>

<p>
He swung round into Flaxman’s Court, and
Miriam, following, paused for joy, mentally
summoning heralds to precede and a brass band
to follow him, so stately with head held high
and plunging gait controlled to a military
strut, was his entry into the humble street.
He stopped just as she moved aside to gain
her door, swung right about and bore down
upon her, bowing, slouch hat in hand.
</p>

<p>
“<em>Allow</em> me!” a deep hollow stage voice.
</p>

<p>
She halted surprised. He was close by her
<a id="page-127" class="pagenum" title="127"></a>
side, his hat replaced with a flourishing movement
that released from his person the thick
odour of stale smoke, the permanent smell of
the ground floor. The grotesque figure, now
crouching, all dilapidated cape and battered
sombrero, over the keyhole, was the owner of
the windowful of stone and marble.
</p>

<p>
“Enter madam,” he declaimed, flinging
open the door. Thanking him, she moved into
the passage and was going on towards the stairs,
but the hollow tones broke forth again, reverberating
in the narrow space made dark by
the closing of the door:
</p>

<p>
“I am greatly honoured,” he was saying,
“by this event.”
</p>

<p>
She turned perforce. He was again profoundly
bowing. She could just discern the
dim outlines, the cape winged out by his deep
obsequiousness.
</p>

<p>
“You will, I trust,” the voice was meditative,
suggesting <a id="corr-8"></a>words ahead to be delivered
with care: “not deem me intrewsive in expressing
in your gracious presence,” indeed,
Miriam felt, her presence was gracious compared
<a id="page-128" class="pagenum" title="128"></a>
to this exhalation of concentrated odours
stifling and making her long to be away and up
the stairs, “my respect and furthermore the
great and happy en’ancement arriving upon
this house by your coming, with your lady
friend, <em>also</em> most gracious, to abide beneath
the roof that shelters my spouse and myself.”
</p>

<p>
“We like being here,” said Miriam, politely,
smiling into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
“Lady, I thank you for your graciousness.”
</p>

<p>
“Not at all,” she said, and felt him silent
for an instant before an evidently unexpected
lapse from gracious ladyhood.
</p>

<p>
This was all most dreadful. His tone had
been deep and broken; touching. Behind his
bombast was something genuine, making high
demands upon her, including her with Miss
Holland, crowning her as a châtelaine. She
had undeceived him, spoken brusquely, revealed
her different state.
</p>

<p>
“I am glad,” she added quickly, in Miss
Holland’s most stately manner, reflecting that
a gracious aloofness was an excellent protection,
<a id="page-129" class="pagenum" title="129"></a>
“that you find us pleasant neighbours.”
</p>

<p>
“More than that,” came the low broken
voice, and her eyes, used now to the dim light,
saw that he bowed more deeply than ever.
“No poor words of mine could avail to express
the felicity experienced in the presence
of beauty and graciousness. I would have you
to know:” he reared his head and spoke
upwards to the staircase, “that I am a repairer
of statoos.”
</p>

<p>
Ah, here was the secret, the real origin of the
attack. But it was interesting. A queer trade.
</p>

<p>
“You have made all those things in your
window,” she said to encourage him, and
standing a little nearer to the stairs composed
herself to endure and listen.
</p>

<p>
“I am a repairer of statoos. But let not
that mislead you. These hands,” he upheld
and waved them in the air, “recall to pristine
loveliness <em>only</em> the classic. In preference, the
<em>Greek</em>.” He was breathing quickly, angrily.
Poor man, without an audience. In his whole
circumstances, no audience. Her interest in
<a id="page-130" class="pagenum" title="130"></a>
his work changed to a desire to give him freedom
from minding.
</p>

<p>
“It would be dreadful to waste your time
repairing rubbish,” she said quickly and added,
suddenly feeling that he was strong enough for
an attempted truth, “only people sometimes
love rubbish <em>very</em> much. For them it is not
rubbish.”
</p>

<p>
“Let them love their rubbish, gracious
lady, let them love—mistake me not. I have
no quarrel with love. The love of the Saviour,
the greatest of all lovers, redeems the statoo
badly made to honour it. But not to Perrance,
not to <em>Perrance</em> let them come if their rubbish
be broken. The classical, the Greek, that
alone of the work of man’s hands can command
the love of Perrance.
</p>

<p>
“So great a love that he has,” he drew a
deep breath, “it may surprise you but it is
nevertheless trew, he has mastered the characters
of the Greek tongue it<em>self</em>.”
</p>

<p>
“Greek is very difficult,” said Miriam.
</p>

<p>
“He can, in the rendering of an account
for ’Ermes repaired, equally as well use the
<a id="page-131" class="pagenum" title="131"></a>
original <em>Greek</em>.” He threw open the door
leading to his little shop, but with no air of
inviting her to enter. He wanted to provide
a clearer light for her contemplation of the
marvel he represented?
</p>

<p>
The light revealed weakness. Large watery
eyes fierce with self-conceit, grown old in
unchallenged self-conceit. An angry mouth,
tremulous beneath branching buccaneer
moustachios. He was waiting for responsive
wonder, ready the moment it should be spoken
to break forth again. His violence calmed her
pity. He was proof against the whole world.
Determined to escape she smiled approval
and remarked in the voice of departure on the
amount of industry represented by the house
as a whole.
</p>

<p>
“Stay,” he cried, “yet one moment,” and
disappeared into the shop, to return in an
instant with some small object clasped, hidden
by his cape, to his breast.
</p>

<p>
“I have here,” he patted his breast with a
free hand, “a small work, a work of my own
hands, dedicated as is seeming and suitable, to
<a id="page-132" class="pagenum" title="132"></a>
<em>womankind</em>. Deign, gracious lady, to accept
the same as a token of gratitude and esteem for
your presence under this roof.” With a deft
movement he flung back the cape and presented
the hidden object. It was the alabaster finger.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no!” Miriam cried. “You must not
give me <em>that</em>.” But he was embarrassed,
holding it forth, his head bent, his voice once
more low and broken.
</p>

<p>
“Take, take,” he said, “I will not sell it
and I shall find no recipient more worthy.
Take, I beg you.”
</p>

<p>
The heavy little block came into her hands.
She gazed at it murmuring appreciations,
trying to thank him in the way he wanted to
be thanked. His eloquence was at an end. He
bowed silently at each phrase, saying only,
when at last she turned to go, “Lady, I thank
you.”
</p>

<p>
He had said his say.
</p>

<p>
But what of the future chance meetings?
What could she give in return for the burden
of this gift, so much heavier than its weight
in her hands?

<p class="noindent">
On her way upstairs, pondering this disquieting
confirmation of her half-hearted candidature
for the estate of dignified ladyhood, she saw
that the first floor rooms were open and the
luggage disappeared from the landing. Passing
the door of the front room she caught a glimpse
of a young woman, her head pillowed on arms
outstretched upon a small bare table, talking
and sobbing in a strangled cockney voice.
The light from the large window fell bright
amongst the coiled masses of her brown hair,
shone through their upper fluffiness, making
a nimbus. She was young and slight; an air
of refinement in the set of her black dress.
Come to live <em>here</em>. Seeking now, of course,
stranded alone in two rooms of this dingy
aged house, her old self, life as she had known
it before she was isolated with him. The
absent him she was so fully revealing.
</p>

<p>
This was marriage, thought Miriam, going on
up the stairs, a bright young couple welcomed
by Sheffield for being so nice and respectable.
<a id="page-134" class="pagenum" title="134"></a>
Tragedy; the beginnings before its dry-eyed
acceptance, of womanly tragedy, the loss
of self in the procession of unfamiliar unwanted
things. In the company of a partner already
reimmersed in his own familiar life.
</p>

<p>
There was weakness in such public careless
abandonment. And subject for the mirth of
cynics. But strength, too, strength of which
cynics, comfortable well-fed people in armchairs,
had no inkling. The strength was
broken for a moment against the walls of a
man’s massive unconsciousness. Upon that
the woman would be avenged; breaking
fiercely through in her search for something
in the world about her to respond to her known
self with its all-embracing radiance. That
strange indestructible <em>radiance</em>, discoverable
in all women, even in those who professed the
utmost callousness....
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-4-3">

<p class="noindent">
How bright, how unfairly upon a gay and
sunlit peak seemed the lives on the top floor
<a id="page-135" class="pagenum" title="135"></a>
compared to those being lived below! How
mean it seemed to be going eagerly up to talk
to Miss Holland, with an evening ahead full
of varied enchantments. Miss Holland to
come back to when it was over; for more
talk.
</p>

<p>
The door of her room stood open, twilight
within. Miss Holland was at home. In the
sitting-room. There would be lamplight,
heralding the brighter radiances ahead.
</p>

<p>
The sitting-room was almost dark. The light
of a guttering candle set on a chair struck
dimly upwards over Miss Holland in her
flannel dressing-gown; mending an ancient
skirt. Her hair in wisps round a face harshly
lit from below, and heavy with shadows. The
reek of spilt paraffin came from the small stove
in the fireplace. It was only an instant’s
vision, rapidly erased by Miss Holland’s
surprised greeting and eager rearrangements.
But the picture of her intense private concentration
on gloomy economies had added
itself to the scene downstairs.
</p>

<p>
While Miss Holland cleared away, Miriam
<a id="page-136" class="pagenum" title="136"></a>
retreated to her bedroom and set Perrance’s
gift down in several places in turn. Everywhere
it refused to harmonise. The delicate
elegant finger suggested a life moving in refined
paths towards extinction; an effigy of that
conscious refinement that speaks more clearly
than anything else of the ugliness of dissolution.
In this room so warm with life there was no
place for a hint from the tomb.
</p>

<div class="poem-container">

      <p class="verse">“Ah, mon enfant, tout cela <em>pourrira</em>.”</p>
      <p class="verse">“Oui, mon père, mais ce n’est pas encore pourri.”</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
She went back to the gloomy sitting-room
eager to communicate to Miss Holland the
newly revealed life of the household.
</p>

<p>
“M’no,” said Miss Holland, “the man
Perrance I have not so far seen. His wife I
fear is a poor thing. A countrywoman, from
Devonshire. London conditions, though I
gather she has lived here ever since her marriage,
are too much for her. And it is only too evident
that she does not recognise the necessity for
hygiene. Everything in their quarters is, I
fear, most unwholesome. And to make matters
<a id="page-137" class="pagenum" title="137"></a>
worse, they keep, like so many childless
Londoners of that class, innumerable <em>cats</em>.
I fear she rarely bestirs herself. He, I understand,
brings in all foods. And requires a great
deal of cookery. She complains in a mopy,
resigned way, about <em>that</em>. I fear they do not
agree any too well. There are, very frequently,
loud discussions going on when I come in at
night.”
</p>

<p>
She spoke with disdainful rapidity, as if
eager to make way for other themes.
</p>

<p>
“He’s a freak, from a circus, the perfect
mountebank. But there’s something, as there
always is in a charlatan.”
</p>

<p>
“I fear I’m no psychologist. I’ve not seen
the man as yet, but I fear, I <em>fear</em> his voice
sounds suspiciously <em>thick</em>. M—— you’ve
seen him?”
</p>

<p>
“He’s given me that finger from the window.
I suppose it’s a paper-weight.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland was transformed. Flushed
and frowning with incredulous approval.
</p>

<p>
“But what a <em>charming</em> tribute!” she cried.
“<em>Indeed</em>, I am surprised. Most certainly I
<a id="page-138" class="pagenum" title="138"></a>
should not have credited Perrance with so
much perception.”
</p>

<p>
“I wish he hadn’t. <em>I</em> can’t live up to graceful
attentions.”
</p>

<p>
“No need, no need.” She was speaking
meditatively towards the shaded lamp. “You
have the secret of charm, an enchanting
possession. Is it not enough?”
</p>

<p>
“That’s an illusion. I haven’t.” She
described the scene on the first floor.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes, dear, dear,” interrupted Miss
Holland, waving it away. “We are in <em>strange</em>
surroundings. Those poor things are <em>not</em>
married. That odious Sheffield who made their
arrival an excuse for calling on me—I did not
tell you. Eh, he is odious,” she shook her head,
childishly screwing up her features. “<em>Odious</em>—believes,
of course, that they <em>are</em>. They are
both hotel employés. It is one of those
unfortunate cases. And they are <em>quite</em> without
circumspection, talking loudly, with open doors.
The young man is a presentable fellow, nice-looking
and respectful in manner. He intends,
I gather, to marry her. There is, of course,
<a id="page-139" class="pagenum" title="139"></a>
an infant on the way.” Without waiting for
response she waved her glasses towards the
mantelshelf.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-4-4">

<p class="noindent">
“I have been looking at your books. That
Shoppenore is an abominable fellow.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, those old essays——”
</p>

<p>
“He permits himself the most unpardonable
insolences.”
</p>

<p>
The châtelaine’s response to Schopenhauer.
Yet since she had not simply cut him and turned
away, since she had read on and been disturbed,
he was not quite disposed of. Evidently, even
for her, the bare fact of his being no gentleman
was not enough. She had thrown an
indignant glance and was waiting.
</p>

<p>
What would she do, if he were sturdily
defended, wondered Miriam, smiling at the
thought of herself as champion of this man
whose very name brought a pang out of the
past. For years she had forgotten him, together
with the reflections that had exorcised
him. It would be a weary business to recall the
steps of that furious battle.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-140" class="pagenum" title="140"></a>
“He was most frightfully sincere.”
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland’s face turned a dull red. She
had really suffered, then, under the lash of
those rhythmic phrases; a little believing.
This was an abyss. Here indeed was the worst
Schopenhauer could do. His least pardonable
outrage. She felt the shock of it reflected
along her own nerves. It roused her to battle.
</p>

<p>
But as she felt her way back to the centre of
the fray she found herself once more siding
with the man, fearing and hating the mere
semblance of woman. Its soft feebleness, its
helpless blind strength in keeping life going.
Felt again all her old horror and loathing of
femininity, still faintly persisting. What was
the answer to Schopenhauer? Swiftly seeking
she passed again the point where she had first
realised the collapse of the Lady, the absurdity,
in the face of ordered thought, of oblivious
dignity and refinement.
</p>

<p>
“He was a Weary Willy. That is to say a
pessimist. A man who attends, by the way the
schoolboy was right, only to the <em>feet</em>. Feet
being, of course, always of clay. He saw life
<a id="page-141" class="pagenum" title="141"></a>
for everybody, going from gold to black, no
escape, and each generation in turn fooled by
nature, through woman, into going on.”
</p>

<p>
“How beautiful upon the mountains,”
whispered Miss Holland, “are the feet——”
</p>

<p>
“Peace. Yes. But the staggering thing
about all these men, the Hamlets and the
Schopenhauers, is that they don’t notice that
people are <em>miserable</em> about being miserable.
And uncomfortable, in varying degrees, in
wrong-doing. When they make up their
philosophies of life they leave out <em>themselves</em>.
Like the people who talk of the vastness of
space and the ant-like smallness of humanity.
If <em>one</em> man, say Schopenhauer, <em>sees</em> quite
clearly all the misery of life, and that it ends,
for everybody, in disease and pain and death,
then there is something in mankind that is not
corruption.
</p>

<p>
“Then again all these thought-system people
must have an illogical as well as a logical side.
A side where they don’t believe their own
systems. If they quite believed, instead of
making a living out of their bitterness they
<a id="page-142" class="pagenum" title="142"></a>
would make an end of <em>themselves</em>. But you
know <a id="corr-9"></a>it’s popular. There are lots of people who
revel in it. Men particularly. It makes them
feel superior.
</p>

<p>
“And there’s another thing in these people.
By the way they generally have long <em>thin</em>
noses. Perhaps they don’t breathe properly.
But the great thing is that you must consider
life <em>obscene</em>. You must look at it from the outside,
as shapes, helplessly writhing in the dark.
If you <em>see</em> all this and Schopenhauer did, you
grin and snort and stand aside. <a id="corr-10"></a>Women, he
proves, don’t see it. And so they <em>are</em> obscenity,
blind servants of obscenity, forever.”
</p>

<p>
“Horrible. Horrible.”
</p>

<p>
“That doesn’t matter. It isn’t true. It’s
words. Nothing can ever be expressed in
words.”

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">E</span><span class="postfirstchar">very</span> friend to tea at the club is an
event. Never-to-be-forgotten. What
each one says is written in my memory. And
all of them are more real there than on their
own backgrounds. Simpler.
</p>

<p>
They are overwhelming, bringing both life
and themselves; at large. Shining; so that
I want not to talk to them, but to keep them
there in place and contemplate them.
</p>

<p>
But for them it is dull. Perhaps embarrassing.
They find me empty-minded, distraite.
And do not know why I am distraite. When
they go, there is no reason for asking them to
come again, but my desire to contemplate
them.
</p>

<p>
Except Mrs. Orly.
</p>

<p>
Every moment in her presence is realisation.
She babbles.... Has no ideas. No self.
<a id="page-144" class="pagenum" title="144"></a>
Knows nothing about anyone. But redeems
everyone.... God can’t be worse than Mrs.
Orly. And if she were on the judgment-seat,
everyone would be recklessly forgiven. With
a flushed little face and flashing eyes she would
spank. Flare and scold. And then, pitiful
helping hands. Unscrupulously covering.
</p>

<p>
Having no self, she brings everyone a rich
sense of self.
</p>

<p>
Most people, all the time, in every relationship,
seek only themselves. Past selves, if they
are old....
</p>

<p>
Affection is joy in things past or things to
come? Bereavement is losing one’s deposits....
That would explain why old people
always think the past, the world of their own
time, better than the one that is developing
under their eyes. We can take only what we
have. Even from genius. The accepting party
must have within himself the same genius.
Otherwise, no taking what is given. There
comes a new way of thinking; a new world.
But ultimately the changed world is the action
of one’s own spirit. The only sureness in things
<a id="page-145" class="pagenum" title="145"></a>
is the action of one’s own spirit. Egoism.
But egoism carried far enough....
</p>

<p>
Whoso would save his life must lose it.
But not for the sake of saving it. And first
he must have a life he loves well enough to
make it worth losing. Perhaps all those big
sayings of Christ are dangerous for small
people. So the Catholics won’t trust them
with the Bible. The Bible let loose means a
crowd of uncultured little churches; fighting
each other.
</p>

<p>
Insufficient egoism keeps people plaintive.
That’s another line of thought, but it joins.
Egoism must be huge. Free from self.
</p>

<p>
Then I am the smallest thing I know.
Caring only for the come and go of days, and
the promise of more days. There is not a
soul I would sacrifice myself for. Nor even
Michael, in his helplessness. When I felt
that the world must stop to prevent his going
to the Russian war, it was myself I feared to
lose. Otherwise I should want to stop the
world for all who go to be killed on battlefields.
I do; a little. But that may be fear.

“You were a lovely person in your blue
gown.” A lovely person in your blue gown....
</p>

<p>
“You were a lovely person in your blue
gown.”
</p>

<p>
For that moment, walking across the empty
spaces of the large high room full of blazing
lights—that was when it was I felt him looking,
and felt myself not there but looking on, with
his eyes—I was a lovely person in a blue
gown....
</p>

<p>
“You were a lovely person in your blue
gown. Again you surprise me with a new
aspect. I’ve seen you look charming, in
Miriam’s quiet way. Didn’t know you could
be splendid. Don’t fly out. It’s all right.
I’m staying friends. Honour bright. For the
present.”
</p>

<p>
That was written in the study in some
luminous interval, eyes on a person crossing a
room in a blue gown. Written on his principle
of the niceness of saying nice things and having
them said.... He is right. It works.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-147" class="pagenum" title="147"></a>
“You were a lovely person....”
</p>

<p>
Yet there is something wrong in his way of
wanting effects, illusions. Seeing through
them even while he goes under to them. Outline
and surface, the lines of flowing draperies,
carriage, the shape of a skull, he sees as fine
because he sees them emerging from a fire-mist
and a planet. Pitiful, and passing in their
turn towards other forms. Yet those he singles
out are at once in a solemn compulsion.
Comically consecrated. Set somewhere between
heaven and earth.
</p>

<p>
But for a while it is a real state ... changing
you.
</p>

<p>
What a difference it made to the sitting here
in the club smoking-room, waiting for people
to arrive. This might have been shivering
loneliness, nervous anticipation of coming
guests. Instead, there was calm, easy anticipation
and forgetfulness. Yet even now he
might be moving forward to some fresh beginning
<a id="corr-11"></a>that would set her definitely in the
past.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile she was launched in a tide flowing
<a id="page-148" class="pagenum" title="148"></a>
brightly to music.... Launched with her
own hands still steering the fragile barque ...
how to continue the metaphor? ... the
bright firelight was intruding another. The
launched barque was best, suggesting cool
freedom and movement. If it stayed in
mind it would serve to shape the letter to be
written to-day or to-morrow. To-morrow
it must be, with the full evening ahead
to be followed by the disappearance of the
secret life in the companionship of Miss
Holland.
</p>

<p>
To-morrow at Wimpole Street, where perhaps
already another letter would have
arrived....
</p>

<p>
The fragile barque; ships that pass in the
Light. In sunlight. There is no night. For
those who are alive there is no darkness.
Meetings and meetings and meetings, and
every time a new setting.
</p>

<p>
“You are being made. You’ve no idea how
you are growing.”
</p>

<p>
Better to find out for oneself and be grateful.
But he must always be instructing.... Yet
<a id="page-149" class="pagenum" title="149"></a>
there was joy apart from him. Joy that
had lived so long in secret, flowing out
now across the strange world of people and
events.
</p>

<p>
She blessed the club. Its gift at the moment
when solitude had departed from her home-life,
of a new solitude; strange lives surrounding
her without pressure, and sometimes
granting these large quiet moments.
</p>

<p>
The door opened upon Miss Holland....
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland at an immense distance. And
somehow changed; coming in like a visitor.
She was dressed, what she called twollettay, and
evidently at the height of her social form.
Free for the evening and looking in here on
her way almost as if she knew how supporting
would be her familiar figure, ceremonially
transformed, at this moment of first launching
out as an evening hostess.
</p>

<p>
Miriam watched her come largely down the
empty room. Ah, hers was splendour, par
exemple! How well she bore the high
spaciousness. Hers was an effectiveness that
made its own terms, in advance.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-150" class="pagenum" title="150"></a>
“They’ve made you an enchanting
table,” said Miss Holland, reaching the
fireplace to stand sideways, firm hand on the
mantelpiece and well-shod foot extended to
the blaze.
</p>

<p>
Miriam had given no thought to the table.
She gazed admiringly. What nobility of form
and outline....
</p>

<p>
The large shady hat hid the limp hair and
gave the eyes more than their usual depth.
They were alight altogether, hesitating. She
was communing with herself, eager to communicate.
What? Something about Flaxman’s.
No, or she would be frowning. And
this high social moment was not for such
things.
</p>

<p>
Miriam plunged into the story of her visit
to Dr. Densley, compressing it to a few phrases,
and throwing up her hands with the despairing
gesture of the correct hostess off duty, told how
he had invited himself to her party as an
awkward fifth.
</p>

<p>
“But he gave you good news, or you would
not look so bonny and happy.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-151" class="pagenum" title="151"></a>
“Said Densleyish things. A number of old
saws. Overwork, late hours, heading for a
crash. Said that for a New Woman I am
disquietingly sane, and that my criminal
carelessness about things that most women are
in a reasonable hurry over, may possibly
mean that I’m in for a long life.”
</p>

<p>
“A most ingenious theory!”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t know. He’s been reading Shaw.
Can’t believe that women really think about
anything but capturing a man; for life. He
wound up by imploring me not to miss marriage
and what of all things do you think is his idea,
or at least the idea that most appeals to him
in marriage? The famous ‘conflict for
supremacy!’”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed an unfortunate definition of
matrimony.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, but wait. That’s not all. Talk about
women getting hypnotised by ideas! His mind,
his so scientific mind—is putty. With immense
solemnity he informed me, ‘<em>No</em> woman, dear
girl, is truly happy until she is the loser in that
supreme conflict.’”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-152" class="pagenum" title="152"></a>
“Dear, dear! An essentially pagan view.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s the view of a man who knows he would
lose.”
</p>

<p>
“I trust you did not tell the poor thing
that!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, but I did. I know it’s begging the
question. But I say things like that on
principle. Anything to break up addlepated
masculine complacency. Not that it
matters a toss to women, but because it’s
all over everything in the world like a
fungus, hiding the revelations waiting on
every bush.”
</p>

<p>
“What was his response?”
</p>

<p>
“He looked very sick for a moment, and
then laughed his laugh and began repeating
himself. Went back to his saws about wasting
youth.”
</p>

<p>
“Indeed, indeed, many are doomed to
that. There at least he is right. Though
most certainly not in regard to yourself.
A propos, I am dining here, with the
Wheelers. The child is in great trouble.
The Polish ’cellist, it seems, is not after all
<a id="page-153" class="pagenum" title="153"></a>
to be in London this season. She is in
despair.
</p>

<p>
“Of course, after coming across the world
to see him.”
</p>

<p>
“In despair. They must now, if they can
raise sufficient funds, go to Poland. It seems
that there is a lady, high up in the social scale
and a patroness of musicians in general, who
might be willing to help, provided that the
’cellist is willing to see the child and to make
an exception to his rule of not taking pupils.
It is therefore imperative to communicate
with him by <em>letter</em>. I have been wondering
whether your Russian friend ...”
</p>

<p>
“Michael. Of course. I’ll ask him to-night.
What is he to say?”
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland was flurried, transfigured;
but still polite. Managing to phrase her
decorous thanks before she hurried, almost
running, away down the room. She returned
in an instant, radiant.
</p>

<p>
“The Wheelers are <em>delighted</em>.”
</p>

<p>
But she was blushing. Evidently the Wheelers
were in the next room. Could easily be
<a id="page-154" class="pagenum" title="154"></a>
brought in to state their needs. She wanted to
keep them to herself. Be all in all to their
stranded helplessness. And when a moment
later a maid announced Dr. Densley, she made
at once for the door, where she was held up for
a moment by his entry, and so escaped back to
the tremendous consultation.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-5-3">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Dr. Densley, hands outstretched, had made
his smiling rush down the room and taken her
lightly by the shoulders when the door opened
to admit Michael. Summoning Densley from
the hearthrug to the bright central light, she
introduced them. They stood in a strange
little silence. Densley, robbed of his usual
soft-voiced flow of words and laughter by the
spectacle of Michael, of whom he had heard
so much, was taking a moment for contemplation,
sure no doubt that she, like all the women
of his world, would immediately emit suitable
remarks. She ignored the obligation, flouted
a suddenly realised desire to please him by
<a id="page-155" class="pagenum" title="155"></a>
filling up the measure of his large admiration,
for the sake of watching these two old friends
for the first time confronted.
</p>

<p>
It made them strangers to herself, people
seen for the first time. Divested of their
relationship to her they were at once diminished
and enlarged. Large and separate, each set
in the stream of his own life. And small;
small figures in a moving crowd.
</p>

<p>
It was Michael who broke the silence,
announcing with stern shyness and courteously
bent head that the profession of medicine
was arduous and at the same time most
fascinating. Miriam saw the other man, as he
stood listening with a dawning smile to the
slow stately English, read Michael’s gentle
spirit and hand him on the spot a protective
affection. They stood talking. Michael bowing
to punctuate his phrases but with a pleased
smile shining behind his pale features, ready to
emerge when the gravity he thought fitting
to the occasion should have had its due.
Densley, below a brow grave and thoughtful as
Michael’s but without its sadness, smiled his
<a id="page-156" class="pagenum" title="156"></a>
smile that was laughter, the laughter of his
everlasting enchantment.
</p>

<p>
She left them to spy from the landing for
any sign of the arrival of the Taylors. The
silent empty hall brought her a vision of Dora,
hurrying home to dress, meeting a friend on an
island in the midst of traffic, one of those
encounters that occur whenever one is in a
hurry, and to which Dora would give herself
as if space and time had no existence.
</p>

<p>
The gong rang out and residents became
audible descending from the upper rooms.
</p>

<p>
She went back to summon the men and warn
Densley that he had committed himself to a
meal prepared in honour of the Taylors,
without meat. Also that he would hear from
Mrs. Taylor all about the medical profession.
His to-and-fro gust of laughter left him open-mouthed
like a mask of Comedy, silently
gazing at her his assurance of his readiness for
all her friends might do.
</p>

<p>
Through the open door she heard the continuous
rustling descent of residents. All the
tables would be full. So much the better, in
<a id="page-157" class="pagenum" title="157"></a>
case her oddly asserted party should produce
long silences. She felt no desire for conversation
and wondered as she led the way downstairs
whether hostesses in general suffered the
indifference that now held her in its grip.
And if they did, why the business of entertainment
was not abolished. She remembered
how porous to the onlooking eye were people
gathered talking at a feast. To be merely
a silent guest was troublesome enough, but it
was nothing to the burden of being obliged
to produce, before the assembled eyes of the
twenty residents even the semblance of a dinner-party.
</p>

<p>
The dining-room was full of sound as she
went in followed by the two men, held a little
in the rear by the backward sweep of her long
gown; a fabric of sound unbroken at any
point in the rows of tables set against the walls,
and all, even the one she had selected, fully
occupied. All heads were averted, intent towards
centres.
</p>

<p>
Gentlewomen. Yes; but those were just
the people who saw without looking.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-158" class="pagenum" title="158"></a>
Here was the secretary at her elbow, smilingly
indicating.... Miss Holland was right, there
in the central pool of light, well away from the
serried ranks of small square tables, was the
club’s settlement of the problem of five diners,
a round table, gleaming with silver and glass
and festive with bowls of flowers.
</p>

<p>
As they took their places, falling accidentally
into the best distribution for her serenity,
herself facing away from the main wall and its
unbroken row of diners, Michael on her right
giving them his impressive profile, and Densley
across the way, his fine easy presence set full
towards them, a servant announced the arrival
of the Taylors. She left her party begun, with
Densley, grave and kindly, set towards Michael
to draw from him and cherish, just anything
it might occur to him to say.
</p>

<p>
Dora and George, unbelievably there,
brought to the decorous hall its furthest
reach of odd experience. They came from so
much further than the long distance they had
travelled across London to spend an evening
in the land that to them was not even Philistia,
<a id="page-159" class="pagenum" title="159"></a>
but just Bedlam. The Bedlam of an illusion
so monstrous as to be comic—for all observers
but those who toiled helplessly at its provisioning;
George’s “under-dog.”
</p>

<p>
They stood face to face, not seeing her.
George in the half-light and against the dark
ancient furniture, looking more than ever like
the young Beethoven, his searching eyes bent
beneath a frowning brow upon Dora’s serene
face of an intellectual madonna upturned in
absent-minded protest, while he explained,
certainly not for the first time, exactly where,
in their passage across London, they had missed
their way. For an instant Miriam watched
them, the beauty that together they made
standing there in perfect physical contrast,
a rare pure balance, as rare as their unmistakable
equality of spirit. She rejoiced in the
thought of them set down with Michael and
Densley. Four widely separated worlds met
together.
</p>

<p>
When actually they were so set down, George
on her left and Dora all delicately harmonious
colour between Michael’s and Densley’s black
<a id="page-160" class="pagenum" title="160"></a>
and white, the enchantment was so strong
that she felt it must radiate to the four corners
of the room. It served to support her in face
of the absence in her thoughts of anything
that could form a starting-point for general
conversation.
</p>

<p>
She took refuge with Dora. Dora’s was
the mind that could enclose all the others,
and gaze over each of their territories in
turn. She began at once by accusing Dora.
Making her the culprit of the wandering
pilgrimage.
</p>

<p>
Delicately flushing, her limpid absent eyes
aware of the presence about her of disturbed
people waiting for conversational openings,
aware also of the restraining influence of her
serene beauty, Dora defended herself in the
leisurely dimpling way that showed her armed
for no matter what conflict. Dora was at her
best. Densley hung towards her delighted at
once.
</p>

<p>
Here in strange garb and unfamiliar
bearing was yet, he was assuming, the woman
he understood, the woman existing in such
<a id="page-161" class="pagenum" title="161"></a>
numbers in his own set, and vocal, until
Miriam had revolted and silenced her, in all
his conversation; the woman who professes
to be either amused or shocked by sexual
allusions, disguised in commonplace remarks,
and jests back, or tactfully heads off. How far,
she wondered, would Dora, with her hobby
of endless cool sampling of humanity, go out
to meet this naïve masculinity? So far she
sat screened, gently glowing, harmless.
</p>

<p>
If she held to this mood, went on turning
upon him her lovely mild eyes, and Densley’s
warm-hearted worldliness took the field, then
it was George, indulgent to Dora’s adventure,
who would be the enclosing, contemplating
mind. Already, amidst the jests that carried
them through the first courses, he was gathering
fuel for the sole recreation afforded him by
chance social festivities. For mirth over the
spectacle of evasions. To-night the spectacle
was all about him, all over the room, rampant
and unconscious, distracting him almost completely.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-5-4">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
By the time the sweets appeared there were
two groups at the table, Dora and Densley,
averted towards each other in animated talk.
George and Michael responding to everything
Miriam offered, usually both at once,
refusing to blend. Here, already, at her
first party, was the English separation.
No general conversation. Not even the
English alternative, the duel between two
men; the prize-fight. The party had fallen
to bits. But it was worth while. For on the
far side of the table, Dora’s sweet mezzo was
dominating Densley’s baritone. She had
tackled him. It was his opportunity, perhaps
his utmost chance of being lifted outside his
complacent dogmas.
</p>

<p>
It was presently evident that he was remaining
impermeable. Though still listening and
responding, he had lost interest, discovered
that she did not for all her soft appeal, fall
into either of the classes he thought he understood,
either into the fascinating, the maternal,
<a id="page-163" class="pagenum" title="163"></a>
or the saintly. His mind gave her its ear, but
his eyes with their everlasting message went
again and again to a far corner of the room.
Which of the disdainful club residents had
become his chosen companion?
</p>

<p>
Dora was questioning him now, collecting
physiology. Her voice penetrated the subdued,
rapidly thinning talk coming from the small
tables. Glancing round as if in search of an
attendant, Miriam discovered the long row
of diners, lingering over their coffee, one and
all intent upon the centre table. And in the
far corner that was drawing Densley’s glances,
Mrs. Wheeler, talking with Miss Holland and
her daughter, both with their backs to the room
and unable to see the distant bourne of her
eyes, dark and gleaming above the heightened
flush upon her cheeks as she sat there, mutely
wise, telling him a plain tale of gallant endeavour.
</p>

<p>
The women at the table near the fireside
were now openly staring.
</p>

<p>
As if by arrangement, by some operation
of the fascinated attention of these two
<a id="page-164" class="pagenum" title="164"></a>
listeners, there was a sudden silence all over
the room.
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” said Dora’s voice into the
midst of it, dreamy as her pose, elbow on table,
hand supporting chin, brow lifted in thought
above eyes gazing into space: “we shan’t
get parthenogenesis until we want it.”
</p>

<p>
The silence ended in abrupt risings and
departures.
</p>

<p>
“Not in our time,” Densley had said,
encircling the departing ladies with a smile
that was not only homage and benediction,
but glee. Private glee over the addition to his
store of anecdotes, of such a fine new specimen.
He, at least, thought Miriam, as they rose
from the table, would not regret the evening
spent outside his world.
</p>

<p>
Michael, half risen, bowing towards the
centre of the group, had something to say.
One of his generalisations. The party was
united at last.
</p>

<p>
“These speculations,” he announced to the
group Miriam rejoiced to see not only arrested
by the inevitable topic but charmed by his
<a id="page-165" class="pagenum" title="165"></a>
gentleness, feeling the pull of him in their
midst, “are most-interesting. There are it is
sure in these matters no absolute certainties,
but what is sure is, that the realisation of
this idea would be, not advance, but retrogression.”
</p>

<p>
“Hear, hear,” said Densley, in his smoothest
girlish falsetto.
</p>

<p>
As they all went down Fleet Street on their
way to the Lycurgan meeting, Miriam wondered
whether she would be asked to resign
from the club. But much more pressing than
this question was the feeling that her party
had, in bringing together three of her worlds,
shown her more clearly than she had known it
before, that there was no place for her in
either one of them. So clearly that she now
wished it could end and leave her to go to the
meeting alone.
</p>

<p>
There was in Lycurgan meetings some sort
of reality, either coming from the platform
or more often from irrelevant things rising
in her own mind as she sat surrounded by so
many speculative minds.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-166" class="pagenum" title="166"></a>
But to-night she would not reach unconsciousness
of her surroundings. And the ideas
coming from the platform would be severely
tested by these alien presences. Already in
advance, these ideas looked like a mere caprice
of her leisure hours, a more or less congenial
background of thought upon which presently
might emerge a sudden enlargement of her
own life. More and more lately they had
been growing to mean things shared with
Hypo, bright with life because they were his,
and for the same reason suspect, suspect
because of his unrivalled expressiveness, a
faculty that might be turned with equal conviction
in a quite opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
And once they were in the hall and she was
sitting with the serene worlds of Michael and
Densley and the Taylors close to her, the
urgency of all the Lycurgans stood for grew
immediately less. This world of clear ideas
summoning mankind to follow like an army,
seemed again, as when she had first met it,
to contain a trick, to be too clear, too hard,
too logical to embrace the rich fabric of life.
<a id="page-167" class="pagenum" title="167"></a>
She experimented in unthinking it; and a
silence fell on many of the flagrant cruelties
of civilisation. They lost their voice. Their
only educated, instructed voice. The Lycurgans
were a league to arrest cruelties. But
a cold, cynical, jesting league, cold and
hard as thought, cynical as paganism and
cultivating a wit that left mankind small
and bleak, in a darkness where there was
no hope but in intelligent scheming. Even
the women. The Lycurgan women were all
either as hopelessly logical as men, or methodically
pink. And the men; the everlasting
prize-fight, the perfect unsociability underlying
their cold ideas. Except for one or
two. And they were idealists, blind with
the illusion that humanity moves with one
accord.
</p>

<p>
Each one moves singly. To join the
movements of others is harmful until you
have moved yourself. Movement is with the
whole of you. Ideas come afterwards.
</p>

<p>
How much time had passed? Only a
moment or two. The chairman was still
<a id="page-168" class="pagenum" title="168"></a>
bleating. And they had not noticed her inattention.
</p>

<p>
They were sitting in a row at the back of the
hall. The proceedings seemed very far away.
Held off by their nearness to each other, by
the way after one short hour and in spite of
their incompatibilities, they were, when
placed amongst strangers, in touch with
each other.
</p>

<p>
It was worth while. Worth while to miss the
intensities. To be happily surrounded. And
this way, the social and domestic way of meeting
things, the cool easy way of normal people,
was perhaps the best way. It robbed things of
all but their obvious surfaces, the practical
data of life. Reduced them to the terms of
what could be said about them and handed
round from one to the other. Small wonder
that reformers tended to become tub-thumpers,
so immense must be the resistance offered by
people living as nearly everyone did, in groups,
closely related and drawn this way and that by
perpetual single instances.
</p>

<p>
Less wonder that most people assumed the
<a id="page-169" class="pagenum" title="169"></a>
fact of life, took it without amazement, for
granted, so thinly of necessity was spread
their awareness of anything whatever. Homeopathic.
</p>

<p>
She gave herself up to joy in her party, in
being linked with them in profane, mirthful
detachment from all that was going forward,
shockingly accompanied by the crackling of
Michael’s disgraceful bag of hardbake. Was
it her fault that they were so detached? The
result of some demoralising influence at work
behind her imagined interest in socialism?
She felt it was not. They were all on a moral
holiday, not only from their own worlds, but
from any world whatsoever. Happy in being
together, passing through an uncalculated
interval, a strange small time that they would
remember with pleasure.
</p>

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-5-5">

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Going homewards through the spring evening
with Densley she felt the world even further
off; thin, irrelevant. That was his influence.
For him the world was something against which
<a id="page-170" class="pagenum" title="170"></a>
everyone was fighting with weapons feeble or
stout. Single people, the individual battle,
that was the centre of his preoccupation. His
interest in Mrs. Wheeler was his sense that she
was making a good fight, sturdily, perhaps
unscrupulously ... that she was what he
would call a real woman. Herself he regarded
as so far unreal, good material for reality,
holding back.
</p>

<p>
His wide, varied experience of humanity
seemed all about them, as they wandered at
truce arm-in-arm through the darkened evening
streets. And she found herself, as always,
leaning upon his ordered knowledge and yet
repudiating it, so entirely did it imply an
incomplete conception of life. Every symbol
he used called up the image of life as process,
never in any direction as completeness.
</p>

<p>
Faced alone, it appeared to him as bitterly
sad, and the last disaster of an unhappy
fate.
</p>

<p>
Faced in groups as he knew it best, it showed
in his eyes only as material for comedy. It
was of the comedy he was always trying to
<a id="page-171" class="pagenum" title="171"></a>
convince her. In life itself the bare fact of life,
there seemed for him to be no splendour.
For men there was ambition, hard work and
kindly deeds by the way. And for women
motherhood. Sacred. The way to it pure
comedy; but once attained, life for the mother
in a mansion of the spirit unknown to men,
closed against them and forever inaccessible.
The attainment of full womanhood was farewell,
a lonely treading of a temple, surrounded
by outcasts.
</p>

<p>
He stood, it was true, to some extent within
the lives of women, but witnessed again and
again the farewell, saw the man lessened, left
behind for ever on the threshold of magnificence,
the woman left in a loneliness mitigated
only by the fireside companionship.
</p>

<p>
The strange thing was that seeming to
value her for what he called the intellectual
heights that had kept her uncorrupted by
petty social life, he yet wanted her to come
down from them and join the crowd. That
if even for one moment she could show any
unguarded feeling, anything free from criticism,
<a id="page-172" class="pagenum" title="172"></a>
even deliberately freed from criticism, he was
ready to become the gay priest of initiation
into the comedy whose every dramatic possibility
he knew by heart.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> morning lays cool fingers on my heart
and stands there an intensity of light
all about me and there is no weight or tiredness.
When I open my eyes there is a certain amount
of light—much less than I felt before I opened
them—and things that make, before I see them
clearly, an interesting pattern of dark shapes;
holding worlds and worlds, all the many
lives ahead. And I lie wandering within them,
a different person every moment. Until
some small thing seen very clearly brings back
the present life and I find a head too heavy to
lift from the pillow and weariness in all my
frame, that is unwilling to endure the burden
of work to be done before the evening can
come again bringing strength.
</p>

<p>
Yet what ease of mind I have now. What
riches and criminal ease, exemptions and riches.
<a id="page-174" class="pagenum" title="174"></a>
Everything is done for me and I am petted and
screened from details. Secretly she plans my
comfort, saying nothing.
</p>

<p>
And at Wimpole Street it is the same. And
there also it is the work of a woman. The
fiancée, who has altered <a id="corr-13"></a>so many tiresome things,
lifted off so many burdens.
</p>

<p>
“You ought not to carry those heavy ledgers
up and down stairs. You are killing yourself.”
Perhaps it was the heavy ledgers. Anyhow
there is now always this fearful weariness
side by side with the happiness.
</p>

<p>
Life flowed in a new way. Many of the old
shadows were gone; apprehensions about the
future had disappeared. Side by side with the
weariness, and with nothing to explain its
confidence, was the apprehension of joy.
</p>

<p>
Wearily she tumbled her happy self out of
bed feeling as her feet touched the floor the
thrill of the coming day send a small current
of strength through her nerves. If only she
could preserve it. But everything nowadays
came headlong and smiling, everything and
everybody. No enemies, no difficulties. With
<a id="page-175" class="pagenum" title="175"></a>
every hour glad tidings calling. Calling from
yesterday. Crowding to-day so closely that
much must be missed, joy scamped and missed
and waiting and pouring over into to-morrow
that would bring yet more things.
</p>

<p>
Why me? What have I done? Why is it
that something seems to be looking after
me?
</p>

<p>
One can’t change one’s nature, which is
one’s fate. Yet there is a sense of guilt in
finding everything so easy.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I shall have an awful old age? No,
from forty to sixty is the best of life. I shall
go on getting happier and happier. Because
it takes almost nothing to make me as happy
as I can bear.
</p>

<p>
But there is this terrible tiredness. Densley
may be right. But one can’t marry just to
escape fatigue. “Have you noticed, dear girl,
that we have spent a whole evening together
without argument?”
</p>

<p>
“I never argue, bless you.”
</p>

<p>
“You give me your blessing?”
</p>

<p>
“What need have you?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-176" class="pagenum" title="176"></a>
“My dear girl.”
</p>

<p>
“I’m neither dear nor in the least
girlish.”
</p>

<p>
“You’re a girl, my dear, unspoiled by worldly
women, the dearest I know—with a man’s
mind.”
</p>

<p>
“It’s your fashionable patients, parasites,
helpless parasites, I’m not blaming them,
who make you think women are all cats.”
</p>

<p>
“My dear golden girl, all grace and charm
if only she chose, when do I see you again?”
</p>

<p>
The milk boiled over and Miss Holland
laughed from her bed. Again it had made a
frightful mess on the oil-stove. Nearly every
day Miss Holland had somehow to make that
mess disappear. Yet she always laughed. Was
now gaily getting up to the accompaniment
of her usual jests on the catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
It seemed enough for her that she lived in a
glow of another life. For that she seemed
willing to pay any price in unseen labour.
</p>

<p>
“Did you speak to your friend about writing
to the musician?”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-177" class="pagenum" title="177"></a>
“Indeed?” What a strange, sharp note....
</p>

<p>
“Not last night. I shall see him to-day
probably, or to-morrow.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam could feel wrath coming through the
curtain.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland was speechless, her large frame,
moving now impatiently about, a boiling
wrath. Evidently she had undertaken; would
now have to explain to these cherished friends.
But what a turmoil! How easy to find words
for them and carry them along a little. Was
the whole world to be stopped for their
letter?
</p>

<p>
She was glad she had spoken with serene
indifference. Evidently her evening, the shape
of her evening entertaining friends, was nothing.
Her usefulness, to these wonderful acquaintances,
all she was worth. It was careless, of
course, to have forgotten. But she was glad
now that she had forgotten. Glad to see
for how little Miss Holland could adopt a tone
of frigid annoyance. Damn, she thought,
I’ve undertaken it. I’ll do it in my own time.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately on the heels of her own
<a id="page-178" class="pagenum" title="178"></a>
words and preceded by little sounds expressing
the depth of impatient scorn, came Miss
Holland’s most fastidious voice:
</p>

<p>
“Had it been made to a <em>man</em>, your promise
would at once have been carried out.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam forgot her anger in amazement at
the spectacle of a châtelaine with a volcanic
temper and a spiteful tongue. She searched
her memory in vain for anything to equal the
venom of this attack.
</p>

<p>
“After that, you count upon my asking
him?” she said, feeling herself adream, lost
in pity before the revelation of the importance
to Miss Holland of these club acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
For herself, the little idyll in the rooms was
at an end. That could be marked off at once,
at the cost of a small pang that turned, even
as she wondered in what form short of an
instant withdrawal of herself and her belongings
the insult could be wiped out, to an
indrawn breath of freedom. But side by side
with the thought of vengeance, came forgiveness.
It was all simply pitiful....
</p>

<p>
The answer to her quiet question, reaching
<a id="page-179" class="pagenum" title="179"></a>
her as she passed into the next room, was a
burst of weeping. She paused for a moment
to be sure of the astonishing sound and fled
from it, closing the connecting door. This, she
felt, was the last depth of shame, to be involved,
to have been subject to this meanest of all
abandonments....
</p>

<p>
She and Miss Holland were separated now,
utterly. The principle at stake was before
her like a sanction, holding her at peace. She
dressed serenely, her thoughts browsing far
away. The milk, boiled afresh, made a tea
more excellent than usual. The two biscuits
were a pleasant feast. The dreadful little room
seemed for the first time to establish a direct
relationship with herself.
</p>

<p>
With never a backward thought, she went
out into the spring sunshine, five letters found
waiting in the box, rich in her hand. One
from him. There might be another on her
table at Wimpole Street. But the letters,
even for to-day, his letter, stood away, waiting
friends around her spellbound calm. It was
not, she told herself, the calm of mere indifference.
<a id="page-180" class="pagenum" title="180"></a>
It was the calm of perfect opposition
to a certain form of baseness. It brought
peace and strength.
</p>

<p>
In beatific mood she sat down at her table
and wrote to Miss Holland that on the terms
set by her this morning she must decline to
discuss anything whatever. The moment her
letter was dispatched, anger seized her. She
hoped Miss Holland would suffer all she could
in anxiety over the success of her project.
</p>

<p>
Miss Holland, it was clear, despised her and
wished, had found, in wishing to make her look
small in her own eyes, crushing eloquence.
And what she had said was true, in a general
way. Often and often, memory told her, she
had sacrificed women for men, baldly, visibly.
But then there had always seemed to be something
at stake. Now there seemed to be nothing
at stake. She wanted nothing so much as to be
charmed and charming. And that she was so,
or her thoughtless happiness mysteriously
made her so, things multiplied perpetually
around her to declare. Apart from the
menace of devastating fatigue, she swam in
<a id="page-181" class="pagenum" title="181"></a>
joy, felt even dark things turn to joy within
her mind.
</p>

<p>
The old life and death struggle between
conflicting ideas had died down. She could
see the self who had lived so long upon that
battle ground, far-off; annoying, when thought
of as suffered by others. But it was not without
a pang that she looked back at that retiring
figure. It had been, at least, with all
its blindness, desperately sincere. She was
growing worldly now, capable of concealments
in the interest of social joys, worse, capable of
assumed cynicism for the sake of advertising
her readiness for larks she was not quite sure
of wishing to share. And thought was still
there, a guilty secret, quiet as a rule. Sometimes
inconveniently obtrusive at moments
when she wished most to approximate to the
approved pattern of charming femininity.
</p>

<p>
Fearful of really forgetting her commission
she wrote at once to Michael and floated off
into her day, her mind away in the bright
pattern of life, the scenes of the many dramas
being played out all round her, of the new
<a id="page-182" class="pagenum" title="182"></a>
worlds into which unawares her obscure
career had led her, secure in the knowledge
that while she lived thus sunnily, all difficulties
in the daily routine would solve themselves
under her hand.
</p>

<p>
A charm, the charm that came over the
leads where the birds hopped, and into the
conservatory-office in the spring sunshine, lay
over everything. Shadows were there. The
shadow of Nietzsche, the problem of free-love,
the challenge of Weiniger, the triple tangle
of art, sex and religion. Poverty and Henry
George. But she was out in the dance of
youth, within hearing of all that was happening
along the rim of life as it pressed forward into
a future that was to be free of much that had
darkened the being of those who went before,
and had freed her already from the fear of
isolation and resourcelessness. She was ready
now to drop all props and wander forth.
</p>

<p>
Lo here, lo there. But the Kingdom of
Heaven is within. Communist colonies were
not a solution of anything.
</p>

<p>
Yet the kingdom within is a little grey
<a id="page-183" class="pagenum" title="183"></a>
and lonely. Marriage is no solution, only
a postponement. A part solution for some
people.
</p>

<p>
I am a greedy butterfly flitting in sunlight.
Enviable, despicable. But approval of my way
of being speaks in me, a secret voice that knows
no tribunals. The joy and ease of this evening-lit
life is a presage because it is a fulfilment.
Man never is, but always to be blest. But I
<em>am</em> blest. <em>Alles ist relativ.</em> I am blessed beyond
anything I ever dreamed of, within these
inexorable circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The happiness that came when they were
even bleaker was a presage. Of what? Someone
says there is nothing meaner than making
the best of things. But happiness is incurable.
A thing you can’t help. Perhaps it is the result
of being a woman. One of Wells’ crawling
cabs waiting to be hailed? Bosh. If I wait
for anyone it is for one who will show himself
to have been hailed by the same kind of
happiness.

<p class="noindent">
Mrs. Cameron running singing up the stairs,
pushed open the door and stood tall, a
bright questing figure; determinedly bright,
a deliberately cheerful blue overall covering
all but the sleeves of her multi-coloured gown;
hanging from her arm a great basket of primroses.
</p>

<p>
“Good morning,” she laughed. “How ist
with thee?”
</p>

<p>
Miriam delighted in the gaiety of colour
she made standing there in the flood of top-light;
in the heroic tilt of her head, in everything
but the deliberately rousing, deliberately
gloom-flouting ring of her laugh, which yet so
frequently breaking forth, was the thing that
compelled her tired eyes, tired bright hair and
thin face into harmony with the gay colours
of her house and clothing.
</p>

<p>
She smiled from her place at the table,
made room for Mrs. Cameron in her mind and
prepared to squander, in seeing life with her,
a bit more of the morning hour. Mrs. Cameron
<a id="page-185" class="pagenum" title="185"></a>
came in pleased, and began at once with her
legends. Miriam read off in her own thoughts
legends to match. It was a clear shape,
deliberate. A way of ignoring all but the
shining surfaces. Of setting everything, even
the old woman dying penniless in the Mews,
in a light that made surfaces shine.
</p>

<p>
But her way of denying gloom brought gloom
in the end. Spread it everywhere. Miriam
felt herself drooping, was glad when she rose
spindling up to her full gay height and settling
herself on her feet with a little spring that
made the primrose bunches jostle each other
in the basket.
</p>

<p>
“I’m off to kirk with Donald. A special
service. There’s a call,” for the first time her
face clouded, “a need abroad in the air for
intercession, Mr. Groat says, a <em>wonderful</em> turning
for help and guidance. <em>Such</em> a hopeful
sign.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said Miriam sympathetically, “certainly
it is.” But her mind was arguing that
there is nothing in the world that is not a
hopeful sign.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-186" class="pagenum" title="186"></a>
“The state of <em>society</em>,” breathed Mrs.
Cameron, eagerly dropping her voice. But
Miriam had left her. The whole day would not
be long enough for the enterprise of getting
Mrs. Cameron down to underlying things. She
wanted the bright figure to stay, gathering
the beams of the spring sunlight before her
eyes, but Mrs. Cameron had read the opposition
in her face.
</p>

<p>
“Fare thee well, lassie,” she chanted in hillside
voice and flung, as she went, a bunch of
primroses on to the table. Miriam pursued her
for a word of thanks. From half-way down
the stairs she turned with a piercing smile, and
sang out:
</p>

<p>
“It’s your <em>life</em> you are living here, lassie, and
flowers are for all.”
</p>

<p>
Miriam turned back. The small bunch lying
upon the scatter of charts and letters was there
to brighten her life that was spending itself, had
spent itself for the ten years since she left
home, the years that are called “the best.”
So Mrs. Cameron saw it. So perhaps everyone
would see it. She herself the only blind
<a id="page-187" class="pagenum" title="187"></a>
spectator. It was true. This scene that she
persisted in seeing as a background, stationary,
not moving on, <em>was</em> her life, was counting off
years. The unlimited future she meted out
for the life she was one day to lead appeared
to Mrs. Cameron defined, a short span.
</p>

<p>
A tap at the door and Eve coming in with
the mid-morning soup and her look of adoring
care. She moved in the room with a restrained
eagerness. Taking her time. Never still,
yet waiting, savouring as Miriam was savouring,
their perfect interchange, the sudden lift into
happiness that came to them in each other’s
presence. Miriam stood motionless, suddenly
conscious of herself as standing considering
Mrs. Cameron’s judgment with bent head,
and then as utterly relieved of it by Eve who
passed to and fro close by her as if she were not
there, and was gone with a light click of the
gently closing door. And there had been an
endless moment of communion, a moment for
both of them, of oblivion and renewal in the
presence of a lover.
</p>

<p>
It was part of Eve’s wonderfulness that she
<a id="page-188" class="pagenum" title="188"></a>
should have come in just then, to answer
Mrs. Cameron. Miriam held the image of her
in her mind, her gently rounded, ever so little
stocky and stumpy figure; the deep rose flush
on her cheeks over which the cloudy black
hair cast a margin of shadow; the pure serenity
that radiated from her, that was independent
and ultimate. Past accounting for, and independent
of knowledge. That was itself knowledge.
</p>

<p>
And ever since, a year ago, she had first
appeared in the house, she had come punctually
at bad moments, into the room. And had
grown shyly and quite silently to know how
near she was and how precious. She had come
so unobtrusively, replacing the jaunty careless
Ellen gone away with the Orlys. It was
strange, one of those strange hints life brought
that she should have appeared at the very
time of the other Eve’s unbearable death,
bearing not only her name, but her gentle
certainties. And her way of gathering all
spears to her own breast.
</p>

</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Miss Holland’s reply came by hand at teatime.
Victorian hand-writing, with a difference.
Something of rounded warmth in the
longish uprights. She strongly deprecated the
unfriendly tone of Miriam’s note. In after teatime
mood, her mind flooded with the bright
light of the evening ahead, Miriam faced the
distasteful problem. Clearly Miss Holland
wanted her to admit that they had both
been foolish and to suggest that the incident
should be forgotten and a fresh beginning
made. But the balance was not equal between
a deadly insult and an unfriendly tone. Or
was it?
</p>

<p>
Was passionate anger better than cool
reason? Perhaps Miss Holland was right all
through. Be that as it might, it was impossible
to countenance emotional scenes or run any
risk of a touching reconciliation. Still less any
bright amiable forgiveness with its wicked
life-insulting suggestion of “fresh beginnings.”
</p>

<p>
To-morrow, perhaps, in faraway mood after
<a id="page-190" class="pagenum" title="190"></a>
the evening’s revels, something would come in
words that would straighten things out without
offence. There is a straightening-out
process going on in life itself, if left alone.
Already it was possible to smile at the whole
occurrence, at both parties.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t,” she wrote at top speed, “be a
party to the way of settling differences that is
known as feminine. Can’t play any part in
scenes. Can’t face explanations, apologise
or be apologised to. So there we are. My
friend has been written to and will probably
act without delay. There for me the matter
ends. Any further consideration of it would
induce a regrettable attack of profanity.”

<h3 class="no" id="subchap-0-7-1">

</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> enclosed golden light of a party.
People transformed. All wearing the
air of festival. All wandering about with
happy eyes, expectant; the eyes of the beginning
of a party. All but a few, at every
party there were those few.
</p>

<p>
And at this party, very soon almost all were
like the few. For a while they had gone in
and out of the three rooms as if looking for
something that was about to reveal itself.
Something they know is there and are always
seeking.
</p>

<p>
Something very joyous. The joy of a party
is the newness of people to each other, renewed
strikingness of humanity. They love each
other, to distraction. Really to distraction.
Before they fall into conversation and separate.
</p>

<p>
A large party. More than large enough and
<a id="page-192" class="pagenum" title="192"></a>
varied enough, as the crowd thickens, to
represent the world. Whatever that is....
And because at least by sight, all are known to
each other, each one’s quality already tested,
expectation is baffled. A few go on seeking,
will go on all the evening, looking forth from
themselves as if sooner or later the gathering
would assume a single shape and perform a
miracle.
</p>

<p>
This must be true of all gatherings, of all
except religious meetings. The strangeness,
and the hopes aroused by strangeness, are
illusions. Mirages arising wherever people
gather expectantly together. The few who
at parties have not the glint of expectation in
their eyes are those who know this. Some are
cynical. Some enduring. One or two ignore
people as persons. See them only as parts
of a process.
</p>

<p>
It is true then, though town-life hides the
fact, that individual life cannot begin until the
illusion of wonderful people presently to be
met, is vanquished. The whole world, all
the scattered people brought together and
<a id="page-193" class="pagenum" title="193"></a>
made known to each other, would soon be
like this party, each tested and placed. Even
the best of them known as limited.
</p>

<p>
Then domestic life, troglodyte life, is the
severest test of quality. The coming to the
end of the charm of strangeness. Of Exogamy.
The making terms and going on, or the hard
work of silently discovering near things afresh.
Re-thinking them. Keeping them near, as
strange things are at first near, and, like strange
things, beloved.
</p>

<p>
“What have I to do with thee?” Yes.
But that was a man who had a message for
everyone in the world and very little time to
get round with it. Not the voice of one who
is weary of the near in space and time and
hopes to find the distant more appreciative.
</p>

<p>
Yet even he demanded a personal allegiance.
“If ye love me, keep my commandments.”
What is love? Who can interpret commandments?
They all stood round adoring, begging
for explanations and instructions. Perhaps he
meant, “You admire what I am. Take my
hints. You will find out the rest.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-194" class="pagenum" title="194"></a>
Wandering eyes were growing rarer, though
still new-comers arrived and toured hopefully.
Groups were forming of people masked, or
visibly bored, sustaining the familiar. Wit,
surrounded, was hard at work. Here and there
rival theorists were audible, disarmed by the
occasion and affably wrangling. And everyone,
even the schemers circulating girt and keen, or
wearing the veil of nonchalance, waited now
for the gathering to do something of itself.
For here for good or ill in the circling Lycurgan
year, was a party, and everyone counting on at
least a moment’s distraction.
</p>

<p>
How intolerable with its challenge, its
throwing back the self empty on to the self,
and its revelation of the weariness of selves,
would be the whole spectacle, but for here
and there a figure of sincerity bearing the
burdens of the rest, drawing nerve-poisoning
influences from the air.
</p>

<p>
Full, the rooms were now. A moving bright
maze of people and amongst them many
strangers, guests. A leaven of the unthinking
world, as the Lycurgans were the leaven that
<a id="page-195" class="pagenum" title="195"></a>
was to drive through the world of thought.
But the strangers were not the zest of the
meeting. Now that they were here, with
their bearing of eager curiosity or amused
polite deference, being introduced, talked to,
some already the centres of arguing groups, it
was through the familiar figures that life
seemed most strongly to flow. Again as in
family life; the quality of the familiar showing
clearest under the beam of an alien light.
</p>

<p>
Densley, hurrying from far away with arms
outstretched.
</p>

<p>
With the sense of coming down through
space, that held her still, yet welcoming, with
a welcome not for him, but for the strange
journeying, his and hers, she reached level
in time to rise and greet him as he seized her
hands. For a moment he surveyed her through
his laugh. Then they were off, arms linked, on a
tour of the rooms.
</p>

<p>
Eyes gleamed at him as he went debonnair,
talking, not listening, needing no response but
her radiance and abandon to his guiding arm.
Solace at once; a rebuilding of strength to
<a id="page-196" class="pagenum" title="196"></a>
face this crowd that now stood off, no longer
impinging, no longer eloquent except of a
friendly indifference. Life, through all
happenings, could pass like this. Happenings
would be disarmed, bright strangeness rooted
in an unexamined sameness. There would be
solace for all the wounds of thought in his
unconsciousness. But no companionship. For
a long while nothing at all of profound experience
and then, perhaps, her whole being
arranged round a new centre and reality once
more accessible, but in a loneliness beside which
the loneliness of the single life was nothing.
</p>

<p>
He would never know this. A listening
radiance and superficial statements and activities
would satisfy him. Yet he suspected a
rival and respected, while contesting its power.
Offered as a substitute his own secret life of
faith in human kind, his shining love. For
him all these special people gathered here
represented not a determined movement to
arrest juggernaut, but material for joyous
existence.
</p>

<p>
... Is civilisation juggernaut? Are there
<a id="page-197" class="pagenum" title="197"></a>
not within it as many, and more, of those who
promote its best qualities as there are of
socialists attacking its defects? And of those
like Densley, who work consciously for the
increase of human happiness, how many there
are and how much kindlier than these people,
most of whom seem so little kind, so much
merely the jealous custodians of ideas....
</p>

<p>
“Ideas are such chancy things. We not
only can’t get along without them. There’s
no escaping them, and they are all figures of
speech.”
</p>

<p>
“<em>Homo sapiens</em>, eh? Well, so long as he has
a good figure ...” Kind imbecile, imbecile,
but kind. “But ideas, my dear girl, are not the
greatest thing in the world. And they easily
take one too far away from life.”
</p>

<p>
“That wouldn’t matter. But while they
last they keep you on a monorail. All specialists
are on monorails.”
</p>

<p>
“Monomaniacs, eh? Now tell me who is
the lassie in the white smock?”
</p>

<p>
“That’s a djibbêh. And her name is Nora
Beaworthy. Keep your pun. Although I
<a id="page-198" class="pagenum" title="198"></a>
daresay in the end she will. All those pink
people will be worthy when they’re grey.
Anyhow it’s no good. Having had a thoroughly
vivid time and made a number of hurried
young men take up socialism, she’s now
engaged.”
</p>

<p>
“She leaves me heart-whole, my dear. But
I saw her on the way here, running at top
speed down Pall Mall in her white gown,
the spirit of spring.”
</p>

<p>
His glance was wandering as it always would,
gathering up and delighting in bright youth,
in the appearance of animation; utterly blind
to all the tricks of conscious attractiveness.
Blind, too, to cattish subtleties. He was wax
in the hands of his mondaines.
</p>

<p>
She looked round for people upon whom he
might exercise his social graces. Who would
give him what he needed to keep him at his
glowing best. But there were none here of his
kind. None who rushed thoughtlessly through
ready-made evolutions. Refusal to accept these
evolutions at their surface value he would see
only as uncharitableness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-199" class="pagenum" title="199"></a>
Alone together, he and she might make
terms. But in his ready-made social surroundings
they would at once be antagonists.
The so much less sociable, so much more
discriminating socialists became suddenly dear,
the salt of the earth. They were, after all,
little as she knew them, her own people. She
thought with them, was ready to act with
them. They, and not those others, were her
family.
</p>

<p>
She chose a group of young women and set
him in the midst of their ready smiles and
swift replies. Saw them sum him up.
</p>

<p>
Dancing was beginning in the end room.
The first dancing she had seen since she left
home. It held her eyes. People transfigured,
circling, lit from above. But only for a moment.
It was memory that had put the happy haze
about them. They were clear and cold, not
lost in their dancing. Not even those whose
heads gleamed with youth. They danced
with a difference. They were the new generation.
</p>

<p>
She longed to dance and drop the years.
<a id="page-200" class="pagenum" title="200"></a>
And here, as if in ironic commentary, was
old Hayle-Vernon, handsome in smooth evening
dress, stepping elegantly towards her. With
a light in his young dark eyes. He too felt his
youth beckon and come close.
</p>

<p>
“Shall we dance?” His pallor was flushed.
With boyish uncertainty. With the distance
he came in ignoring that they were strangers.
</p>

<p>
To him her twenty-eight years were infancy.
He was saying so with his smile. Knew,
besides, no more of their number than of her.
She felt her youth rise to lead him back to his,
and his gratitude for the gift vibrating in his
smooth voice as he began, the moment they
swung in amongst the dancers, by remarking
that it was pleasing to see Lycurgans as ready
to hop as they were to hope. On and on as
they circled—the tails of djibbêhs beating
about them, every couple vocal, some straining
away from each other as they danced, to argue
more effectually—his voice persisted. Her
scraps of reply, though he bent his head for
them until his beard brushed her cheek, did
not get through his slight deafness. But all
<a id="page-201" class="pagenum" title="201"></a>
they had in common, known to them both,
was speaking between them, making a sadness;
making them hate each other for apprehending.
Never again would they attract each other
from afar, nor ever now that they had spoken,
want to speak again. Unless presently they
could meet in some mental difference. She
gathered as his voice went on, emerging
suavely above the primitive swinging pressure
of his body and theorising now, about art in
the socialist state, material for discussion when
presently they should be seated.
</p>

<p>
But on their sofa in the alcove they were
immediately joined by Arnold Englehart who
stood before them deferentially, yet like a
threat; equally oblivious of Hayle-Vernon’s
deep-seated indifference to socialism and of the
sacredness of sitting-out couples, pouring out
his newest plan to bring about socialism in a
fortnight.
</p>

<p>
Englehart was real, and his plans burned as
enthusiastically as upon his bent head his hair,
lit from behind and standing out like a bush
above his unseeing face. Hayle-Vernon was
<a id="page-202" class="pagenum" title="202"></a>
alight in pursuance of his hobby of pulling
a thread of thought through shapeless assertions.
But in every word he spoke sounded his central
unbelief. Prominent Lycurgans. Good men.
Keeping an eye on injustices. Trying, from
whatever motive, to reform the world. One
chasing an abstraction called humanity, and
the other an abstraction called intelligence.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that the air grew icy about them.
It was a relief to catch sight of Densley, beaming
with social happiness. Through the rising
tide of Englehart’s talk she watched him afar.
Tall and lean and swiftly graceful in all his
movements. Yet padded. A lean tall firmly-padded
baby. The slight rotundity of his
slenderness, like his bantering man-of-the-world
society talk, was the radiation of his
substantially nourished mind. His mind spoke
from his broad unconscious brow. Serene
and attentive between his frivolous words and
friendly curling hair. A Harley Street brow.
Calm where all these Lycurgans were irritable.
And in his shapely nose, slightly blunted, like
so many professional noses, was the cause, or the
<a id="page-203" class="pagenum" title="203"></a>
explanation, of his interest in philosophy.
Flirtatious interest, in the intervals of listening
for the ever-changing gossip of science and
accepting, because they bore out his own kindly
experience, the statements of evangelistic
religion.
</p>

<p>
“Multiple shops, proliferating—” she glanced
in time to catch Hayle-Vernon’s flicker of
amusement—“like a cancerous growth.” But
Englehart’s adoration of Wells was a charming
<em>décor</em>, taking nothing from his individuality.
He had so much intensity that it blazed, like
paraffin, a little wildly, but never with the
wind. That was the great thing about the
Lycurgans. That they thought. They were
not impressionists further than everyone,
by being merely alive and not sure of the
whence and the whither, must be helplessly
impressionist.
</p>

<p>
The accumulations of two years of attention
to Lycurgan thought, the images fashioned by
their more articulate intelligentsia to express
their sense of the destruction of modern
civilisation by disorderly forces grown out of
<a id="page-204" class="pagenum" title="204"></a>
that civilisation were again uppermost as she
returned to the thought of Densley and his
indiscriminate social happiness. His friendship,
for instance, with little Mr. Taunton. Perhaps
that was inevitable. Poor little Taunton,
shocked into worldly wisdom by his experience
at the hands of Eleanor, flying, from his refuge
under the tiles with his Plato, into marriage,
must now have visitors. And doctors and
clergy and lawyers must hang together. And
their wives support the fabric. “A <em>charming</em>
little woman,” said Densley, “she listened
while her man and I discussed the sacraments.”
Meaning that Densley and Taunton putting
their heads together about religion were
swimming in waters beyond her depth; that
she being not only a woman, but charming,
that is to say an apparently uncritical listener,
sat respectfully by and earned in due course the
indulgent lowering of the conversation to
matters she could understand. But would
they have talked so busily, kept on their
amicable duel, without an audience? And
would they have been so serene if they had seen
<a id="page-205" class="pagenum" title="205"></a>
into her thoughts, seen her read them as she
watched their play?
</p>

<p>
Conversation of this type, comfortably fed
and armchaired men discussing in the presence
of deferential wives, was the recreation of his
less frivolous leisure. And for the rest,
fashionable dinner-parties, opinions about the
latest plays and the latest novels, scandals, the
comparing of notes about foreign travel,
hotels and so on—always the same world,
always shut in however far away, with the same
assumptions, not about life, for these people
never thought about the fact of life, only
about the details of living, and about behaviour.
His world was ready-made, and clearly now as
she watched him for the first time from afar
and socially surrounded, she saw that if she
went into that world she would fail him; fail
just where a rising doctor’s wife must be a
tower of strength.
</p>

<p>
The sadness of farewell, bringing with it
in equal companionship a humiliating annoyance,
was shallow; farewell to a selfish coveting,
doomed all along by its heartlessness. Yet
<a id="page-206" class="pagenum" title="206"></a>
even as she saw him cut off, going his own bright
way, it stirred within her, asserting a depth she
had not guessed; prompting to recklessness,
reminding her with a long backward glance
how clearly, through all the years she had
known him, “fate” had been at work throwing
them together in solitude, carefully not revealing
him in association with grouped humanity
until now. To draw back now was to reduce
their common past from the moment of his
coming, bounding lightly at midnight into
Eleanor Dear’s garret, an abrupt tired man, prescribing
a sleeping draught and thankful to get
away as soon as he knew there was someone
prepared to stay all night and not afraid to go
out and ring up a chemist, to waste of time.
</p>

<p>
Waste of time in an alcove—a comfortable
alcove inviting waste of time by being there and
being unable to protest. Waste of time;
except for the gathered knowledge of his
goodness? Perhaps Hayle-Vernon, whose
elegant sophistries had at last broken the tide of
Englehart’s talk and left him standing, still
eager, aware that his ardour had miscarried,
<a id="page-207" class="pagenum" title="207"></a>
and <a id="corr-15"></a>though not actually looking about him, yet
already on the lookout for another listener,
had gathered, in the time Englehart had wasted
with him, a knowledge of Englehart’s unconscious
goodness?
</p>

<p>
Wilkins the author, gesticulating greetings,
came up and hooked Englehart away by the
arm.
</p>

<p>
With Englehart gone, Hayle-Vernon was
left in a void, statuesque, draped only with
his manner of a prominent Lycurgan. He had
joined the society for the sake of self-realisation,
consciously contributing his proud talent for
straightening out the statements of those who
in so far as they were driven by feelings that
were clearer than their thoughts, were careless
about language? Separated from passionate
conviction he was inoperative. Perhaps,
identifying me with the new group of young
Lycurgans, he credits me with passionate
convictions? And here I sit—while from far
away in the cold centre where he formulates
his criticisms, facing cessation, he is
coming back to make suitable remarks—equally
<a id="page-208" class="pagenum" title="208"></a>
stranded, in a perfect equality of inoperativeness.
</p>

<p>
“You are going to write for <em>The New
Order</em>?”
</p>

<p>
“Not in <em>The New Order</em>. I write about
socialism in an anarchist paper.”
</p>

<p>
“The Impossibility of Anarchy?”
</p>

<p>
“No. That anarchy and socialism are the
same in spirit. Only that socialists think they
can define the future and anarchists know they
can’t.”
</p>

<p>
“That’s very amusing. But, I think,
scarcely true. To begin with, anarchy, as
defined——”
</p>

<p>
Densley, swinging about on his tall stride,
halting for a moment with head turned, near
at hand; seeing her sitting at the feet of a
distinguished looking elderly Lycurgan, moving
clear of groups, keeping himself free to come
forward when the next dance should begin.
Sounding through Hayle-Vernon’s undulating
vocalisation came her own thoughts, as if he
were speaking them.
</p>

<p>
Farewell to Densley is farewell to my one
<a id="page-209" class="pagenum" title="209"></a>
chance of launching into life as my people have
lived it. I am left with these strangers—people
without traditions, without local references
and who despise marriage or on principle
disapprove of it. And in my mind I agree.
Yet affairs not ending in marriage are even
more objectionable than marriage. And celibates,
outside religion, though acceptable when
thought of as alone, are always, socially, a little
absurd. Then I must be absurd. Growing
absurd. To others I am already absurd.
</p>

<p>
There is no one on earth who knows the
right and wrong of these things. There are
only prejudices. Where do they come from?
People are prejudices. Life is a prejudice. Or
it wouldn’t go on. Your life is the prejudices
you are born with. That is determinism.
But something must be determined. By their
prejudices ye shall know them. Not by anything
acquired. By instincts. Which are
judgments ready-made.
</p>

<p>
Free-lovers seem all in some indefinable way
shoddy. Born shoddy. Men as well as women.
Marriage is not an institution, it is an intuition.
<a id="page-210" class="pagenum" title="210"></a>
Marriage, or sooner or later absurdity. Free-love
is better than absurdity....
</p>

<p>
Yet the free-lovers dancing there seemed
both sadness and mockery. Dancing is shimmer.
Satin and silk and white slippers. Rooms
white and gold. Massed flowers. Rapt faces
to whom problems and socialism are unknown.
Youth, and an audience of elderly parents and
friends. It seems mockery for these people
with their brains full of ideas and their bodies
decked in protests, to dance. Dancing brings
an endlessness in which nothing matters but
to go on dancing—in a room, till the walls
disappear—in the open, till the sky, moving
as you dance, seems to cleave and let you
through.

The ring, made by those who remained,
extended when their linked hands were
stretched at arm’s length, all the way round the
large room. These people were part of the
crowd that had stood shouting the refrains
of the folk-songs led by the woman on the
estrade with the determined voice. Seen thus
they had seemed threatening, inhuman; and
<em>édition de luxe</em> <a id="corr-16"></a>of the noisy elements in a street
crowd. And more threatening, because they
were driven by ideas. The massed effect of
djibbêhs and tweeds and dress-suits, bellowing,
was of a wilful culture banded together in
defiance of a world it could not see.
</p>

<p>
But now, standing ringed round the room
with linked hands they were charming.
Innocent; children linked for a game, dependent
on each other. In the midst of them,
somehow in the centre to which all their
faces were turned, was something beyond the
reach of socialism. It sounded even in the
dismal notes of <em>Auld Lang Syne</em> with its
<a id="page-212" class="pagenum" title="212"></a>
suggestion of mournful survival from a golden
past. To stand thus linked and singing was to
lose the weight of individuality and keep its
essence, its queer power of being one with
every one alive.
</p>

<p>
But it was also embarrassing. Made an
embarrassment that everyone had to share.
For the thread of song was stronger than anyone
there. Even those who meeting known
eyes above an unusually opened mouth, or
imagining themselves to be objects of hilarious
scrutiny, tried to be individually funny, were
presently overwhelmed and drawn along. The
thin beginning on a few voices had swelled
to a unison of varying octaves and strengths.
She heard her own voice within it and felt
as she sang how short and wavering and shapeless
was her life, and short and wavering even the
most shapely lives about her.
</p>

<p>
As the dismal refrain was lifting its third
monotonous howl there came from behind her,
where a door opened on to a cloakroom, a
woman’s voice angry, deep and emphatic, like
an ox roaring at a gate. Her hand was torn
<a id="page-213" class="pagenum" title="213"></a>
from her nearest companion’s and the newcomer
was in the ring singing with stern
lustiness below a hat askew. The last words
of the song echoed round the room upon the
might of her voice.

<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> room is still in midnight darkness and
full of the feeling of midnight. There
must have been a sudden sound—perhaps a
wild squealing of cats, too soon after I fell
asleep. In a minute it will begin again; a low
yowling, just beneath the window, growing
louder. Then a scuffle and piercing shrieks.
Silence; and more shrieks, at a comfortable
distance.
</p>

<p>
Savage night-life of cats. Welcome, heard
far off making shrill streaks of light in the darkness
and suggesting daytime; all the friendly
little cats of London.
</p>

<p>
There is no sound. Not a breath. In spite
of the wide open window the air is stifling.
And though there is no breeze, the reek of cats
comes up and in. All the summer it has come
in. It is part of the air of the room.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-216" class="pagenum" title="216"></a>
Yet the nights in here have been paradise.
Cool sleep. Escape from the night-sounds of
the court. Escape from Miss Holland’s
obliviousness of the sounds of the court.
</p>

<p>
She is dull not to hear. Or strong? Dull
strength in not hearing.
</p>

<p>
Noisy home-comings in the spring. Strident,
hideous voices in a reeling procession along the
court and dying away in the distance. Drunken
monologues. Every sound echoing near and
clear in the narrow court. And she heard
<em>nothing</em>. The cobbler, noisily taking down his
shutters in the early light had called her from
sleep, not from feverish dreams. And when
the summer came and sounds filled the court
till dawn, still she heard nothing.
</p>

<p>
Why is all this saying itself over so freshly?
At some moment every night before I go down
into sleep, it says itself. And now I have come
back from half-way to sleep it is all there is in my
mind. Because I am always trying to ignore
it. Never thinking of it by day. And here
it is, belonging to me. Closer than anything
that happened yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-217" class="pagenum" title="217"></a>
Hoarse-voiced lovers lingering on after the
roystering has died down. Men and women
coming in quarrelling from the main street.
Voices that had been gentle for each other
madly seeking lost gentleness in curses. Curses
and blows dying down to a panting stillness;
out there, in the dismal court.
</p>

<p>
Night-long, through open windows, thick,
distorted voices in strife. Shut in, maddened.
Maddened confined man. Women despairingly
mocking. Worst of all, children’s voices
sane and sweet in protest, shrilling up, driven
by fear, beyond the constriction of malformed
throats, into sweetness.
</p>

<p>
And she had heard <em>nothing</em>.
</p>

<p>
But this same thickness or dullness had kept
her unaware of what it was that in the end had
turned this stuffy little back room into a
refuge.
</p>

<p>
She did not know that there were sounds
more intolerable than those coming in from
the street. The street sounds varied. Were
sometimes obliterated by wind and rain, and
were at their worst only at the height of the
<a id="page-218" class="pagenum" title="218"></a>
summer. And even at their worst they were
life, fierce and coarse, driving off sleep; but
real, exciting. Only unendurable because there
was no hope during their lifetimes of any
alteration in the circumstances within which
all these people were confined.
</p>

<p>
But those other sounds never varied. And
spoke of death. That was the worst, that they
filled the room with the sense of death and the
end.
</p>

<p>
They cast a long shadow backwards over the
whole of life, mocking it.
</p>

<p>
Night after night they had to be anticipated
and then lived through. One by one. To
come home late was not to escape them.
They were all there collected in the quiet
room. Centring in the imagined spectacle
of the teeth waiting in their saucer for the
morning.
</p>

<p>
To sleep early was to wake to the splutter of a
match and see the glare of candlelight come
through the porous curtain. To hear with
senses sharpened by sleep, the leisurely preparations,
the slow careful sipping, the weary
<a id="page-219" class="pagenum" title="219"></a>
sighing, muttered prayers, the slow removal
of the many unlovely garments, the prolonged
swishing and dripping of the dismal sponge.
All heralding and leading at last to the dreadful
numb rattle of vulcanite in the basin.
</p>

<p>
Yet the worst to bear was the discovery of
the hatred these innocent sounds could inspire.
Still there unchanged, pure helpless hatred,
rising up as it had risen in childhood, against
forced association with unalterable personal
habits....
</p>

<p>
But the shock of discovering that hatred
anew, finding I have not moved on, only been
lulled into good humour by solitude, did not
lessen the first joy of the little back room.
For a while, in spite of the ugly things in it,
and the never-ending reek streaming in through
the window, the joy remained. There was
that night when I sat writing until morning.
Once more able to expand and think. And the
air seemed as pure as if it had come in over the
country-side....
</p>

<p>
And something of the first joy has remained.
A lower tone. But still here. In the quietude.
<a id="page-220" class="pagenum" title="220"></a>
In the certainty of deep sleep and a happy
mood in the morning.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
To-night, with Miss Holland away, there is
a double stillness. Perhaps I woke because she
is away? For some <em>reason</em>, I woke. Something
to say itself. And all these thoughts, bringing
back the joy of the little room anew, are getting
in the way. Idling along, going round and
round. Me, gossiping with myself.
</p>

<p>
And all the time something is waiting.
Just at hand. Behind the things in my mind.
And now, with me more awake here came the
remains of yesterday. Crowding in to be looked
at. Taking me back to stand and look again to
find out what remains; what really meant
something to me, if I could find out what it
meant....
</p>

<p>
Strangeness of London on Bank Holiday.
Its underside turned uppermost and spread
over the whole surface. Daily London
grown invisible, incredible. Never to come
back.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-221" class="pagenum" title="221"></a>
I’m glad I’ve spent one Bank Holiday in
London. Seen and heard its reality. I’m glad
it’s over. It’s like being separated from a
lover. The blank feeling, at the end of the
afternoon, that it is forever.
</p>

<p>
The certainty that this wild tumult of
people is the reality and the rest a sham. I
almost feared to look at them lest they should
see me wondering <em>why</em> they all go back. Why
they don’t know their power and end the
system that holds them. I fear them. And
to-morrow, with my lover back again, I shall
feel more glad of that than sorry at the
thought of all these people who keep London
what it is to me, gagged again, and chained.
Taken out of my sight. Toiling, out of my
sight.
</p>

<p>
Mean. Fear of losing small comforts and
accustomed dreams. Like a timid elderly
man of fixed habits settling comfortably in
the autumn into his usual chair at the club.
The peacefully noisy streets. Kept clean.
Unconsciousness in the lulling song of the
traffic.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-222" class="pagenum" title="222"></a>
Why should I wander in bliss while they
toil in grime and darkness?
</p>

<p>
In the evening <em>Sayce</em>. Far away from
the tumult; hidden, untroubled in his green
room. Sitting in the window-space, not
giving a thought to the rampant multitudes.
Not minding, not giving a thought to them.
Yet they threatened him as he sat there.
Made his joy small and absurd. Even while
it was balm to see his unconsidered detachment.
To see him, poor and outcast, a
king for the evening, throned in his shadowy
little kingdom in the security of the London
night. If he had given a thought to the
unleashed thousands, or to anyone watching,
in some way his face would have changed.
But he was aware only of his poetry and the
sounding-board, the green-robed woman sitting
low in the opposite chair. Radiant and
composed. But not only listening, not as he
thought, just listening. She, like <a id="corr-17"></a>him, was
special, lived in his world, as an appreciator.
But besides hearing, seeing what he saw, feeling
as he felt, she saw him. Saw, far away within
<a id="page-223" class="pagenum" title="223"></a>
the form turned towards her alone—declaiming
from the book held sideways so that he could
see her face and make towards her delighted
hand-swayings for the passages that pleased
him most—the halting, half man’s half woman’s
adoration he gave to the world he saw, his only
reality....
</p>

<p>
And while she admired, she pitied.
</p>

<p>
And fifty yards away the toilers raged. The
sound of them made the two engrossed figures,
softly lit by the high presiding candle, a little
absurd. Irrelevant and insecure. As if they
might topple. Ought to topple. Ought to
listen and topple down....

Gerald and Harriett. Drawn, driven, washed
about by tides they do not see. Flung on
rocks, washed off and flung forward. Their
unaware faces. Strength of unawareness;
pushing on. That was my comfort—that they
did not know. And because they did not know,
I would not. Clung only to the things they
saw and got away without realisation. Yet I
realised it all. Here it is, tormenting me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-224" class="pagenum" title="224"></a>
There is no choice of what one shall see on
waking by accident. Things are there, set
out clearly, stating their essence. What they
meant when I passed through them feeling
only the movement, from behind closed doors
of <em>le sort</em>. Not thinking, because they were long
prepared and there was nothing to be done.
But there is always when <em>le sort</em> moves, a sense
of guilt. Of having brought things about;
let things happen that need not have happened.
That is why, when they happen, one does not
think. The fear of being crippled by condemnation.
Yet it is all written in the book
of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Written indelibly. Because one can look
to and fro, from one thing to another and each
remains in place, presenting always one face,
like a photograph.

<p>
Gerald and Harriett and Elspeth starting
for Canada. Without good-bye. None of
us dared to say good-bye. Outside the gaslit
compartment seemed nothing but whirling
darkness and cruel laughter. We jested
without a gap. Annoying Elspeth, who
<a id="page-225" class="pagenum" title="225"></a>
longed only for the train to start and the
relations who kept attention from centring
on herself, to be gone. The sound of her
childish complaints was one with the laughter
of the outer darkness. She stood on the seat,
a shining little figure in the harsh gaslight,
clutching the doll Sarah had found time, on
that awful last day, to dress. Beneath her
unconscious feet was the machinery that would
carry her into exile.
</p>

<p>
There they were in the imprisoning carriage.
And then gone. It was a death. Something
buried alive. I dared not feel. There was
relief afterwards in walking down the platform
with Gerald’s sister, a stranger just met, in
knowing by the hard clutch of her hand that
she, too, was not daring to feel. We both
knew we had witnessed a crime.
</p>

<p>
“Can you get home?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes.” Our voices were rough and shuddering.

<p>
“We’ll meet again.”

We unclasped our hands and parted abruptly,
our faces distorted with not weeping.

Michael’s telegram. Once more the presence
of him in the early morning, plunging along
across the wide shadow of St. Pancras Church,
his voice at my side and again the discomfort
of hearing unknown people lightly and swiftly
described as they appeared to him: delocalised,
people in a void. The things he
said about her told me nothing but that she
was courting him and he had no idea of it.
And I let him go in ignorance. Pushed him

she wants, for the time that remains to her,
wide circumstances, ease. Is willing, for the
sake of the ease and space she sees so clearly,
to go to the ends of the earth. “<em>Wide</em> sky;
unstinted air; <em>room</em> to move” exactly in the
voice she uses for “<em>Good</em> Bermaline.”
</p>

<p>
A religious woman, living on prayer; blossoming,
in middle age, into splendid health on the
power of prayer and teaspoonsful of Listerine.
Ready to give up her work amongst the poor
and systematically seek wealth and comfort.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps in the end she will actually go; to
California. Make her way. Master hotel-keeping
as she has mastered hygiene and midwifery,
and confectionery. Leave London as
coolly as years ago she came. And contrive
<a id="page-230" class="pagenum" title="230"></a>
her transference just as she had contrived
this holiday to Edinburgh. Ingeniously.
Horrible ingenuity of genteel poverty: Two
coats and skirts, one on the top of the other,
and a little handbag. By the midnight train.
</p>

<p>
She despises the world, yet uses it. Is using
it now to accumulate money. The being here
with me is now altogether an affair of economy.
But if I were religious, it would not be. I
should be the centre of her personal life.
She would try to get me to California. “Would
you like to come?” and then answering herself
before I had time to speak: “No; you are
too cultured.” But that was long ago. Whilst
there was still the sense of being her great
adventure. Before the trouble about the letter.
Before Miss Trevelyan came to tea. Badly
dressed, with a cold in her head. Tall, like
Miss Holland. Two tall figures sitting upright
in front of the little fire, not lounging, sitting
as if they were just going to move. Both
looking into the fire, Miss Holland with a
pleased smile, Miss Trevelyan stolidly, as she
told without a break and almost without
<a id="page-231" class="pagenum" title="231"></a>
questions from Miss Holland everything that
had happened to her family and friends during
the year. She had Miss Holland’s indifference
to surroundings and her obliviousness of
differences in the quality of experience.
Assumed that everything affected everyone in
the same way.
</p>

<p>
“Miss Brown has married and gone to live
in Birmingham.”
</p>

<p>
To hear them talk was to feel that one
person was making remarks aloud; talking
to herself of shadows in a dream. I began to
understand why Miss Holland found me lively
and charming.
</p>

<p>
And then, when they had formally said good-bye
and Miss Trevelyan had gone out into the
rain in her cloak: “A perfectly happy year
together. We would both gladly repeat it.”
I can see their year. A peaceful association
of two workers. Both disciplined and incessantly
active. Sharing disapprovals. Living
as if in a siege; enclosed and conspiratorial
and happy. Prayers and puns and loyally
exchanged services. A life of perfect agreement
<a id="page-232" class="pagenum" title="232"></a>
untroubled by thought. And I am
jealous. Perhaps it was then, knowing that
if she still desired a renewal of life with
Trevelyan, I was only second-best, that I
really moved away from her. Feeling inferior
as well as superior to Miss Trevelyan. Feeling
hidden in them both something I cannot reach.
That I shall reach one day and meet them
suddenly, when they have both passed out of
my life. Something they have given without
knowing it.
</p>

<p>
It is since then that she has more and more
effaced herself and no longer courted every
opportunity of standing, if only for a moment
and deprecatingly, at fresh angles of vision.
Miss Trevelyan reinforced her. But she still
thinks there ought to be personal affection between
us. Doesn’t notice that I can’t call her
Selina.
</p>

<p>
Failing with her leaves other successes
shadowed.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
To and fro, linked by their common quality
of condemnation, went small forgotten incidents
<a id="page-233" class="pagenum" title="233"></a>
of the year, covering it. There was
nothing else. The central things standing
so brightly in her daytime consciousness were
nothing. Unfounded. Mirage of youth.
Sunlit reflections on the sea within whose
depths she would presently be lost. Life was
being spent in watching the glint of sunlight
upon waves, believing it her own sunlight and
permanent, while all the time it was light
created by others, by millions of lives in the
past, by all the labour that now kept the world
going. And while she had watched the penalty
had been piling up.
</p>

<p>
“I am left in a corner with death.” But
it is I who am left, and not dead. Only out
of my own element in which, if I were alone,
even death would look quite different.
</p>

<p>
And far away below evidence and the clear
speech of events, even now something was
answering. Suddenly like a blow bringing
her sharply awake, it came: refusal. Surging
up and out over everything, clearing the air,
bringing a touch of coolness in the stifling air.
</p>

<p>
“Profanity. My everlasting profanity.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-234" class="pagenum" title="234"></a>
She listened guiltily, glad of its imperiousness.
Everything had been thought out.
There was nothing appearing behind it. There
was in the depths of her nothing but this
single knowledge that she was going away
from this corner where she had been dying by
inches. No consideration of right or wrong.
No feeling for persons; either Miss Holland
or those people downstairs, or those of her own
she had been able to help by this cheaper way
of living.
</p>

<p>
She sighed in pure sadness as she faced this
deeper self. For it was clear now forever that
to be good was not all in all to her. To endure,
suffer long, and be kind was not her aim. She
had never been quite sure whether it was not
the hidden secret of all her decisions, born
in her, independent of thought. Now and then
hearing commendation of endurances that did
not bring bitterness, she had been tempted to
feel that there must be, since she had endured
much and not become bitter, in her own
character the things called sweetness and fortitude.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-235" class="pagenum" title="235"></a>
It had always been a strange moment. Two
impressions side by side. The certainty
that conscious fortitude and sweetness could
not persist in their own right, and the uncertainty
of approving of these things in their
unconscious simplicity; a dislike of being
discovered in a state of helpless merit.
</p>

<p>
Greater than the sadness of not being good,
more thrilling, was the joy of feeling ready to
take responsibility for oneself.
</p>

<p>
I must create my life. Life is creation.
Self and circumstances the raw material.
But so many lives I can’t create. And in going
off to create my own I must leave behind
uncreated lives. Lives set in motionless circumstances.
</p>

<p>
A voice sounded in the hot darkness. Just
outside the window. Almost in the room.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll do you <em>in</em>. If I get you I’ll do you in.”
Sound of furniture violently collided with.
Perrance. Mrs. Perrance.
</p>

<p>
And I’m sitting up trembling. This, the
beginning of this, was what woke me a few
moments ago. The end of their Bank Holiday.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-236" class="pagenum" title="236"></a>
Again a crash.
</p>

<p>
I’m full of horror. Too full of horror for
pity. It is <em>my</em> voice this time that must sound
that awful cry from a window.
</p>

<p>
With her feet on the floor and her hands
feeling for garments, she listened. Perrance
was in monologue. Perhaps he was helpless.
Probably more drunk than Mrs. Perrance.
Perhaps he would talk himself out. Poor man.
Poor woman.
</p>

<p>
This is life. However far I go away, this
will go on. To go away is only to get mental
oblivion of it. Yet that is just what I am
planning. Here in the midst of it is the hope
that my lucky star, the star that keeps even my
sympathies clear of being actively involved, will
carry me through this, too, without bringing it
into my hands.
</p>

<p>
The voice of Perrance was growing high and
thin. Lying down once more in the darkness she
could hear each word wailing out into the
night. He was chanting his loathing of the
mystery of womanhood, cursing it, its physical
manifestations, cursing them to heaven in the
<a id="page-237" class="pagenum" title="237"></a>
vile den created by his ignorance and helpless
poverty. The den where lived the despair
of his isolated mind. Miriam felt its dailyness.
Seemed to be within it and to breathe its
thick odours as she listened. And to rebel and
curse with him. In his soul was light. Something
he felt his wife fought against with her
dark, silent ways. Why did he not murder
her?
</p>

<p>
And the woman was there with her youth.
Before her eyes, pictures of Devonshire. In
her mind wonder at the way things had slipped
down and down, to this; and fear, of this
maddened stranger who desired only her death.
</p>

<p>
Well, they adore each other, they adore each
other, muttered Miriam as quietness fell. It
is terrifying to me because I’m not accustomed.
</p>

<p>
A shriek brought her to the middle of the
floor feeling cool and strong. “Stop! stop!”
she shouted down out of the window. “I’m
coming.” But her voice was drowned in the
tumult below. A blazing lamp crashed out
into the garden and then came the man’s voice
feeble and sane:
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-238" class="pagenum" title="238"></a>
“We mighta been killed. We mighta been
before our maker, Maria.” And a sobbing.
Mrs. Perrance sobbing in serene despair.
Without fear.
</p>

<p>
Away. Away....

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
